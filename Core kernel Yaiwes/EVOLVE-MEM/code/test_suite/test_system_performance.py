EVOLVE-MEM System Performance Test

This test verifies that the system is actually learning from experiences
and retrieving specific information rather than giving random general answers.

Test Design:
1. Create specific experiences with unique details
2. Ask questions that require specific knowledge from those experiences
3. Verify that answers contain the specific details mentioned
4. Test both factual recall and reasoning capabilities
