"""Banking Knowledge domain harness: H2 rules + H4 post-call annotations.

H2 rules (pre-execution, deterministic DB/state checks)
--------------------------------------------------------
LogVerificationUserIdRule
    Before log_verification: user_id must exist in db.users.  Catches every
    placeholder, hallucinated, or bypass-code value before it pollutes the DB.

LogVerificationTimeRule (not wired — kept for reference)
    Before log_verification: time_verified must match get_current_time().
    Replaced by auto-fill in use_tool() to avoid correction-loop regressions.

UnlockDiscoverableExistsRule
    Before unlock_discoverable_agent_tool: tool_id must exist in the registry.
    Catches hallucinated tool names at the unlock step before wasting a call.

CallDiscoverableUnlockedRule
    Before call_discoverable_agent_tool: tool must (a) exist and (b) have been
    unlocked (present in toolkit._agent_discoverable_tools_state).  Together
    with the auto-unlock on KB_search hit this enforces the full workflow
    without adding context length.

H4 annotators (post-execution, reactive)
-----------------------------------------
KBSearchDiscoverableToolAnnotator
    After KB_search: detects tool_ids in results and notes them.  Auto-unlock
    (handled in use_tool override) runs in parallel so the agent can skip
    directly to call_discoverable_agent_tool.

UnlockDiscoverableErrorAnnotator
    After unlock_discoverable_agent_tool fails: redirect to KB_search.

CallDiscoverableErrorAnnotator
    After call_discoverable_agent_tool fails: redirect, remind to unlock first.

CallDiscoverableSuccessAnnotator
    After call_discoverable_agent_tool succeeds: remind about
    give_discoverable_user_tool if a user-facing step is required.

GiveDiscoverableErrorAnnotator
    After give_discoverable_user_tool fails: redirect to KB_search.

EmailNotFoundAnnotator
    After get_user_information_by_email returns no records: try name lookup.

NameLookupEmailHintAnnotator
    After get_user_information_by_name succeeds: surface DB email so agent can
    detect a mismatch → account_ownership_dispute reason.

UserTransferRequestAnnotator
    After request_human_agent_transfer: prompt agent to call
    transfer_to_human_agents immediately.

ReferralsFoundAnnotator
    After get_referrals_by_user finds records: remind to submit_referral.
