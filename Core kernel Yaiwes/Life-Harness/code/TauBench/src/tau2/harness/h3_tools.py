"""H3: Tool-description policy embedding.

Unlike the system prompt (a message at position 0 that gets pushed down by
accumulating conversation turns), **tool descriptions are re-sent in every
LLM API request** as part of the ``tools`` parameter.  The model therefore
sees them at full attention weight regardless of how long the dialogue has
grown.

H3 appends concise, actionable policy constraints directly into the
``long_desc`` of key write tools for a domain.  This is complementary to H2
(runtime validation) and H5 (system-prompt injection):

- H2 catches bad calls *after* the agent decides to make them.
- H5 injects policy into the system prompt (visible at conversation start,
  but decays in salience as context grows).
- H3 keeps the most critical policy rules *always* in the model's immediate
  attention window, acting as a persistent reminder at the point of decision.

Usage
-----
Enable via ``harness_h3=True`` in the run config or ``--harness-h3`` on the
CLI.  H3 is independent of H2 and H5 and can be combined freely::

    # H3 only
    tau2 run --domain airline --harness-h3 ...

    # H2 + H3
    tau2 run --domain airline --harness-enabled --harness-h3 ...

    # H2 + H3 + full policy in prompt (H5)
    tau2 run --domain airline --harness-enabled --harness-h3 --harness-h5 ...

Implementation note
-------------------
``H3ToolDescriptionMixin.get_tools()`` wraps each target tool's underlying
function with a copy whose ``__doc__`` has the hint appended.  A new
``Tool`` object is built from the wrapper so that the ``openai_schema``
(which drives the LLM's tool-call decision) includes the extended description.
The ``ToolKitBase.use_tool()`` execution path is unaffected.

If NONE of the above conditions are met: DO NOT cancel. Politely refuse
and explain the policy. Do NOT attempt workarounds (cabin upgrades,
rebooking, cancel-and-rebook) to bypass eligibility — if the reservation
is not eligible, no workaround makes it eligible.
