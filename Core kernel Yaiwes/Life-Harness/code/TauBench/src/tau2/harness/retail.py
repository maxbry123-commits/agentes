"""Retail domain harness rules and annotators.

All rules and annotators inspect only DB state (no conversation history),
ensuring replay safety during set_state evaluation.

cancel_pending_order
  CancelPendingOrderRule      – block cancel on non-pending orders (R1); explicit messages for
                                cancelled / processed / pending (item modified)
  CancelReasonRule            – reason must be 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake' (R5)

modify_pending_order_items
  ModifyPendingOrderRule        – block modify on already-modified / non-pending orders (R2);
                                  explicit messages for cancelled / delivered / processed /
                                  exchange-or-return-in-progress

  NoDuplicateItemIdsRule        – item_ids must not contain duplicates beyond order quantity (R15)
  ValidateNewItemIdExistsRule   – all new_item_ids must exist in the product catalog; prevents
                                  hallucinated / fabricated item IDs like "X_new_expensive" (R16)
  ModifyItemsProductTypeRule    – new item must be a variant of the SAME product; cross-product
                                  changes are blocked with an explicit error message (R8)
  ModifySameItemRule            – new_item_id must differ from the old item_id being replaced (R10)

modify_pending_order_payment
  ModifyPaymentSameMethodRule    – new payment method must differ from the current one (R6)

H4 Annotator index
------------------
get_order_details
  OrderEligibilityAnnotator   – append eligibility note for tricky statuses: 'exchange requested',
                                'return requested', 'pending (item modified)'. Silent for normal
                                statuses (delivered / pending / processed / cancelled).

get_item_details
  ItemAvailabilityAnnotator   – when available=False, inject a note clarifying that this only
                                means out of stock for NEW orders; the item can still be
                                returned/exchanged by a customer who already owns it.

exchange_delivered_order_items
  ExchangePriceDiffAnnotator  – highlight the computed exchange_price_difference so the
                                agent remembers to communicate it.
  GiftCardBalanceAnnotator    – after gift-card writes, show the remaining gift card balance.

return_delivered_order_items
  ReturnRefundAnnotator       – highlight the actual refund payment method and amount.
  GiftCardBalanceAnnotator    – after gift-card writes, show the remaining gift card balance.

cancel_pending_order
  CancelRefundAnnotator       – highlight the actual refund payment method and amount.
