    Implementations receive the DB snapshot and the successful tool result,

    Unlike HarnessRule this fires on the SUCCESS path — it never blocks the
    call.  Its purpose is to inject state-aware context (order status tables,
    eligibility flags, completion reminders) at the exact moment in the
    conversation where it is most useful.

    Replay safety
    -------------
    Annotators run AFTER the tool executes, so they see the updated DB state.
    Like HarnessRule, implementations MUST only read from DB/kwargs; they must
    NOT have side-effects or maintain cross-call state.
