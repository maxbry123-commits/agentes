## Bench / SWE-bench pipeline terms

### Baseline run
A SWE-bench agent run executed without any PF policy guard. Used as the reference solve rate against which a PF-guarded run is compared.

### Budget drift
A mismatch between the `timeout_sec`, `max_steps`, `max_tool_calls`, model, or model parameters recorded in the baseline and PF run manifests. Detected by `compare_runs.py` when `--require-harness` is set; a drifted comparison is invalid.

### CERT-V1
The community standard schema for verifiable AI certificates. Published at `github.com/verifiable-ai-ci/CERT-V1`; used by PF to structure per-run evidence.

### harness_eval

Block in **compare.json** produced by **compare_runs.py**. Parses **`eval/logs/run_evaluation/<run_id>/<model>/<instance_id>/run_instance.log`** for the line **`Test runtime: N seconds`** (newest run batch wins per instance). Exposes **harness_seconds_per_instance** and a **summary** (median, p90, p95). This is harness test-phase duration, not OpenHands agent wall-clock.

### metrics_full.json

Optional run card next to **compare.json**: solve rates, **harness_eval**, agent latency summaries, **estimated_cost_usd**, and observed version fields. Schema version **metrics_full/1.0**.

### compare.json
The machine-readable output of `compare_runs.py`. Contains baseline and PF solve rates, delta, cost per solved instance, policy violation rates, patch-apply aggregation, empty-patch reason counts, replay success rate, and env-drift fields.

### compare.csv
The pivot-friendly per-instance output of `compare_runs.py`. One row per instance (baseline and PF status, patch-apply result) plus a `_summary` row with aggregate counts.

### Denial recovery
When a PF policy guard denies an agent command but the agent continues and eventually produces a valid patch, the episode is counted as "recovered after denial". Tracked in `compare.json` as `recovered_after_denial_pf_rate`.

### Empty-patch reason
A structured code recorded in `patch_apply_check.json` and `predictions.pfmeta.jsonl` explaining why an instance produced no patch. One of: `agent_no_changes`, `patch_too_large`, `diff_timeout`, `apply_check_failed`, `workspace_missing_or_failed`, `guard_denial_prevented_writes`.

### env.json
A per-run snapshot written by the bench runner at `runs/<run_id>/env.json`. Records Python version, platform, dataset, split, and (when available) `openhands_version`, `datasets_version`, `swebench_version`, and `pip_freeze_hash`. Used by `compare_runs.py` to detect environment drift between baseline and PF runs.

### eval_metadata.json
Written by `run_swebench_eval.py` after each harness run into the eval dir. Records the `run_id`, `predictions_sha256`, `dataset_name`, `split`, `datasets_version`, and `swebench_version`. Used by `compare_runs.py --require-harness` to bind eval results to the exact predictions that produced them.

### experiment manifest
A `manifest.json` in each experiment directory (e.g. `experiments/exp-step2-lite-smoke/manifest.json`) that pins `pf_commit`, `agent_framework`, `model`, `policy_pack`, `budgets`, `seed`, and `run_modes`. Ensures that baseline and PF runs are comparable and that solve-rate differences can be attributed to run mode rather than configuration drift.

### GOLDEN.ok
A JSON file written to `runs/<exp>/publish/GOLDEN.ok` by `update_run_ids_if_green.py` when all acceptance gates pass. Contains `baseline_run_id`, `pf_run_id`, `pf_commit`, `timestamp_utc`, and `parity_gate_passed`. The machine verifier (`verify_publish_bundle.py`) checks for this file.

### harness (SWE-bench harness)
The official SWE-bench Docker-based evaluation framework that runs the test suite for each instance against the submitted patch and reports resolved/unresolved/error/empty-patch counts. Requires Docker and runs on Linux/WSL only.

### instance_ids.txt
A stable list of SWE-bench instance IDs for an experiment (e.g. 20 for the smoke run). Generated once with `sample_lite_instance_ids.py --count N --seed 42`; must not change during an iteration loop.

### parity gate
The acceptance condition `pf.solve_rate >= baseline.solve_rate - 0.01`. If the PF-guarded run's solve rate is within 1 percentage point of baseline, the run is considered to have maintained parity. Recorded as `parity_gate_passed` in GOLDEN.ok.

### patch_apply_check.json
Per-instance evidence file recording the result of `git apply --check` on the produced patch. Fields: `applies` (bool), `stderr`, `base_commit`, `resolved_commit`, `git_version`, and optionally `patch_capped_reason` and `diff_stat_file`.

### PF-guarded run
A SWE-bench agent run where every shell command is intercepted by the PF policy guard before execution. Forbidden commands are denied and recorded as violations in `evidence/events.jsonl`; the agent may continue (recoverable denials). Evidence includes `policy_compliance_summary.json` per instance.

### policy_compliance_summary.json
Written per instance in a PF-guarded run. Contains `compliant` (bool), `violations` count, `reason_codes` list, and `chain_tail_hash`. Always written, even when there are zero tool calls.

### predictions.jsonl
The SWE-bench submission file produced by the bench runner. One JSON object per line with fields `instance_id`, `model_patch`, and `model_name_or_path`. Consumed directly by the SWE-bench harness.

### predictions.pfmeta.jsonl
A PF metadata sidecar to `predictions.jsonl`. Same line count and `instance_id` order; contains `run_id`, `policy_hash`, `trace_hash`, `replay_bundle_hash`, `empty_patch_reason`, and `cost_metrics` per instance.

### predictions.sha256
SHA-256 of the predictions file, written by the runner in the same directory. Recorded in `eval_metadata.json` so `compare_runs.py --require-harness` can verify that the harness was run on the exact same predictions file.

### replay bundle
The captured tool I/O and file snapshots that allow an agent run to be replayed deterministically. `run_replay_sample.py` uses replay bundles to verify that replaying a PF-resolved instance reproduces the same patch hash.

### replay_summary.json
Written by `run_replay_sample.py` after replaying a sample of PF-resolved instances. Contains `sample_size`, `success_rate`, `mismatch_count`, and `replay_fail_reasons_topN`. Merged into `compare.json` by `compare_runs.py`.

### run_id
A timestamped unique identifier for a bench run (e.g. `20260317-120041-1badcd73`). The directory `runs/<exp>/<mode>/<run_id>/` contains all per-instance evidence for that run.

### run_status.json
Written by the bench runner in the same directory as `predictions.jsonl`. Contains `run_id`, `status` (`complete` | `partial` | `failed`), `instances_planned`, `instances_written`, `first_error`, and `created_at`. Used by `validate_predictions.py` and `compare_runs.py --require-harness` to detect partial or failed runs.

### allow-empty-patch
Flag for `validate_predictions.py` and `update_run_ids_if_green.py`. When set, validation passes even if some instances have an empty or non-diff `model_patch` (e.g. OpenHands produced no edit). The cycle script uses it in Phase 2.2/3.2 and passes it to `update_run_ids_if_green.py` in Phase 5a so runs with some empty-patch instances can still update run-ids.md when other gates pass.

### OPENHANDS_PROVIDER
Environment variable selecting the LLM provider for OpenHands: `openai` (default), `anthropic`, or `prime_intellect` (aliases such as `prime` / `prime-intellect` normalize to `prime_intellect`). Determines which API key and base URL the PF bench uses. Resolution, fallbacks, and `runs/<run_id>/env.json` fields (`openhands_provider`, `llm_base_url_source`, `llm_base_url_effective`, `prime_team_id_set`) are implemented in **`bench/swebench/provider_env.py`** and consumed by `engines/openhands_engine.py`, `experiments/scripts/ensure_openhands_config.py`, and `bench/swebench/runner.py`. The cycle script and `resolve_cycle_llm.py` validate the matching key before runs.

### Prime Intellect (prime_intellect)
LLM provider option for `OPENHANDS_PROVIDER`. Requires **`PRIME_INTELLECT_API_KEY`**. If **`PRIME_INTELLECT_BASE_URL`** and **`OPENAI_BASE_URL`** are unset, PF defaults to Prime Inference at **`https://api.pinference.ai/api/v1`** so **`pit_*` keys are not sent to OpenAI's platform API**. Optional **`PRIME_TEAM_ID`** is forwarded as **`X-Prime-Team-ID`** when set. The OpenHands **CLI subprocess** path sets **`LLM_API_KEY`**, **`LLM_MODEL`**, **`LLM_BASE_URL`** (via a local strict-compat proxy when using Prime or other strict OpenAI-compatible endpoints), and copies **`OPENHANDS_PROVIDER`**, **`OPENHANDS_MODEL`**, and **`PRIME_TEAM_ID`** into the child environment so downstream LiteLLM/OpenHands routing matches PF. For **`prime_intellect`**, the engine **always uses the subprocess path** (not the in-process library path) so this wiring is consistent. Model IDs are normalized (e.g. `gpt-4o` to `openai/gpt-4o`) for upstream acceptance.

### scale results ledger
`experiments/scale-results-ledger.jsonl`: append-only log of one row per green run. Each row (validated against `experiments/schemas/scale_results_ledger_row.schema.json`) records solve rates, violation rate, instance counts, and experiment metadata so solve-rate trends are visible across runs over time.

### solve rate
The fraction of submitted instances that are resolved by the SWE-bench harness (i.e. the submitted patch makes the test suite pass). Reported as a float in `[0.0, 1.0]` in `compare.json`.

### swebench_safe_v1
The default PF policy pack used for SWE-bench experiments. Denies network binaries (curl, wget), external git clones over HTTPS, and writes outside the workspace; allows standard build and test commands.

### workspace manifest
`workspace_manifest.json` written per instance under `workspaces/<instance_id>/`. Records `instance_id`, `repo`, `base_commit`, resolved paths, and a SHA-256 hash of the manifest. The hash is recorded in the PF evidence log to bind the run to the exact workspace state.
