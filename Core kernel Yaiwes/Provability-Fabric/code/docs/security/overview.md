# Provability Fabric Security Overview

*This document provides a comprehensive security overview for auditors, security teams, and compliance officers.*

## Executive Summary

Provability Fabric is a zero-trust, enclave-based system that provides cryptographic guarantees for AI system safety and compliance. The system enforces data access policies through cryptographic attestation, capability-based access control, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Design Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is verified regardless of source
2. **Least Privilege**: Access is granted only to the minimum necessary permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: All activities are logged and monitored in real-time

## Cryptographic Guarantees

### Enclave Attestation

- **Nitro Enclaves**: AWS Nitro System attestation for compute isolation
- **SEV Enclaves**: AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization attestation
- **Measurement Verification**: Cryptographic verification of enclave integrity
- **KMS Binding**: Keys released only to verified enclaves

### Capability-Based Access Control

- **Capability Tokens**: Cryptographically signed access permissions
- **Label Flow**: Data classification labels enforced throughout the system
- **Policy Rules**: Declarative policies enforced by the Policy Kernel
- **Receipt Verification**: Cryptographic proof of authorized access

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

- **TLS 1.3**: All network communications encrypted with latest TLS
- **AES-256-GCM**: Data encryption at rest using industry-standard algorithms
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation with configurable intervals
- **Hardware Security Modules**: Keys stored in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSMs

### Data Classification

- **Sensitive Data**: PII, PHI, financial data, trade secrets
- **Label Propagation**: Data labels automatically propagated through the system
- **Access Controls**: Label-based access control enforcement
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of data access and modifications

## Access Control

### Authentication Mechanisms

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all administrative access
- **Single Sign-On**: Integration with enterprise identity providers
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts

### Authorization Framework

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Predefined roles with minimal permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control**: Dynamic access based on context
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary access granted only when needed
- **Access Reviews**: Regular review of access permissions

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

1. **Network Attacks**: DDoS, man-in-the-middle, packet injection
2. **Application Attacks**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, buffer overflows
3. **Insider Threats**: Malicious administrators, compromised credentials
4. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies, malicious packages
5. **Physical Attacks**: Hardware tampering, side-channel attacks

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Network Security**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, DDoS protection
- **Code Security**: Static analysis, dynamic testing, code reviews
- **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication, least privilege
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency scanning (GitHub **Dependency review** on PRs, **cargo-deny** with root `deny.toml`, SBOM diff / Grype in CI), signed releases where applicable, and workflow linting (**actionlint**) when `.github/workflows/**` changes.
