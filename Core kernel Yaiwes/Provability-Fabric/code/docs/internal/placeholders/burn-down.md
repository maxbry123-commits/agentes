# Placeholders and Stubs â€” v1 Burn-Down Tracker

This document tracks every placeholder value, stub implementation, and TODO-as-behavior that must be removed for v1. It maps each item to:

- **Removal prompt(s):** the exact prompt in the prompt series that owns the fix
- **Proof tests:** concrete tests / CI gates that prove the placeholder is gone and behavior is real
- **Status:** OPEN â†’ IN PROGRESS â†’ DONE, plus PR link(s)
- **Policy exceptions (v1):** Sanitized placeholders are allowed only in explicitly allowlisted docs/scripts examples (e.g., Slack webhook example, `ghp_xxx`) as long as they are variable-style and clearly labeled as examples. Everything else must be eradicated.

See [inventory.md](inventory.md) for the full inventory and [decisions-v1.md](decisions-v1.md) for scope decisions.

**Last updated:** Wave 9+ completion pass (2026-07-22) â€” TD-001â€“002/006/007/010/011 closed in code; tenant enforce fail-closed by default. Aligned with remediation-tracker Wave 9+. Live CI posture: [evidence-program-closure.md](../../roadmap/evidence-program-closure.md) (**69** gated, inventory exit **0**).

## Prompt â†’ Scope index (quick reference)

| P9.1 | Ledger migrations: remove rollback_checksum_placeholder (derive or remove) |

## Global proofs (apply to every row)

Every item marked DONE must satisfy:

1. **Gate proof:** `make no-runtime-placeholders` passes (P1), unless the row is explicitly "Allowed example placeholder".
2. **Behavior proof:** At least one targeted test listed in the row passes.
3. **Regression proof:** A test exists that would have failed before the fix (or the gate would have failed).

---

## 1. Explicit placeholders (literal values)

**Status legend:** OPEN | IN PROGRESS | DONE | ALLOWED (EXAMPLE)  
**Audit:** finding ID(s) from [full-repo-audit-2026-07-01.md](../archive/full-repo-audit-2026-07-01.md) when OPEN due to reconciliation  
**PR:** link or TBD  
**Owner:** team/area (runtime, core, services, adapters, tools, lean, bench)

## 4. Lean / proof placeholders

**Policy (v1):** Zero sorry/by admit only in CI-enforced Lean targets; research dirs may contain sorry if excluded from checks.

| ID | Location | Placeholder | Removal prompt(s) | Proof tests | Owner | Status | PR |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|--------|-----|
| LN-001 | core/lean-tools/LabelerGen.lean | placeholder returns | P16 (+ P16.1 if enforced target) | lake build for enforced targets + scoped sorry check | lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-002 | core/lean-tools/ExportDFA.lean | placeholder hash | P16 + P16.1 if enforced | same | lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-003 | core/lean-libs/ExportDFA.lean | "SHA-256 impl placeholder" | P16 + P16.1 if enforced | same | lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-004 | proofs/README.md | notes about sorry | P16 (scope only; allowed if excluded) | scoped sorry check must ignore this dir | docs/lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-005 | docs/dev/lean-build.md | placeholder proofs mention | P16 (scope only) | scoped sorry check | docs/lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-006 | .github/workflows/lean-style.yaml | global sorry scan too strict | P16 | CI passes; scoped scan matches enforced targets | lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-007 | .github/workflows/lean-offline.yaml | same | P16 | CI passes; scoped scan | lean | DONE | TBD |
| LN-008 | tools/proofbot/run.py | references placeholder resolution | P16 | proofbot tests (if any) or CI non-required | tools/lean | DONE | TBD |

---

## 5. Adapters / scripts (placeholder logic)

Mostly example placeholders. v1 policy: allowed if variable-style and clearly labeled.

| ID | Location | Placeholder | Removal prompt(s) | Proof tests | Owner | Status | PR |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|--------|-----|
| SC-001 | adapters/dryvr/adapter.sh | placeholder parsing | P18 | shell test harness or integration test with fixture output + gate | adapters/dryvr | DONE | TBD |
| SC-002 | scripts/db/blue_green_migrate.sh | Slack webhook xxx/yyy/zzz | Allowlisted example | make no-runtime-placeholders must allow this file | scripts | ALLOWED (EXAMPLE) | n/a |
| SC-003 | ~~tools/pr-bot/README.md~~ | removed with orphan tool | — | — | docs/tools | CANCELLED | n/a |

---

## 6. Bench / tools stubs (non-runtime but must be honest)

| ID | Location | Stub/placeholder | Removal prompt(s) | Proof tests | Owner | Status | PR |
|----|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|--------|-----|
| BT-001 | tools/results/summarize.py + .bat | placeholder fields | P4.1 | pytest + Windows smoke + gate | tools | DONE | TBD |
| BT-002 | api/v1/BUF_USAGE.md | suggests adding stub generation | doc-only | n/a | docs | ALLOWED (DOC) | n/a |

---

## 7. Test-only / example stubs (not blockers)

These are not unimplemented behavior and should remain as-is unless they trip gates incorrectly.

| ID | Location | Note | Action |
|----|----------|------|--------|
| EX-001 | runtime/sidecar-watcher/src/main.rs | comment: "Synchronous unit test stubâ€¦" | Ensure gate does not flag benign comments unless policy says so |
| EX-002 | runtime/sidecar-watcher/src/break_glass.rs | PostMortemStub is a real type used in tests | Not a placeholder; keep |

---

## Required add-on prompts (to complete eradication)

To ensure "no placeholders remain" is actually true, the following add-on prompts must be added to the series:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| P4.1 | Tools/results summarizer: replace placeholder bundle_id/signature/replay_drift with real values derived from actual artifacts |
| P4.2 | CLI revoke: implement revoked_by auth context (even if v1 is "local identity", make it real and test it) |
| P7.1 | MPC fintech compliance validators: implement real validation branches or explicit deny with typed reasons (no placeholder acceptance) |
| P9.1 | Ledger migrations: remove rollback_checksum_placeholder by generating/deriving the correct value or removing dependency |
| P11.1 | TypeScript SDK completion: HTTP client lifecycle + idempotent outbound retry (gRPC deferred; verify already real) |
| P13.1 | core/crypto wasm_pool: eliminate placeholder return path; add deterministic tests |
| P17 | VSCode extension webview comms: implement real message passing + tests |
| P18 | DryVR adapter parsing: implement real parsing + tests |

---

## How to close an item (definition of DONE)

A row can move to DONE only when:

1. **Gate:** `make no-runtime-placeholders` passes (P1).
2. **Targeted tests:** The row's "Proof tests" pass.
3. **Evidence:** The placeholder string/stub/TODO-as-behavior is removed or replaced with real logic.
4. **Docs:** Update this file (set status to DONE and add PR link).

---

## Suggested workflow for the team

1. Run P0 and ensure this file reflects current reality.
2. Land P1 early (scoped), so regressions are impossible.
3. Land P2/P3 (trust + crypto fixtures), then P3.5/P4 (manifest + CLI), then P6/P8/P11 (sidecar/receipts/middlewares).
4. Use this burn-down as the PR checklist: every PR must close at least one ID.
