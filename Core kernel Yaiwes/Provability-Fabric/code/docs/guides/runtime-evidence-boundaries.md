# Runtime evidence boundaries

## Runtime evidence overview

Runtime evidence in Evidence v0.1 is an **additive binding layer** on top of existing CERT-V1 sidecar emission. The sidecar continues to write CERT-V1 JSON and append CERT lines to `evidence/logs/sidecar.jsonl`. On every emit path through `write_cert_with_binding`, an `evidence_v01_binding` JSONL event is appended linking the session, cert path, cert digest, and optional bundle reference.

## Event sources

| Source | Event | Output |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Sidecar `emit` handling | `permit_enforcement` CERT emission | `evidence/certs/<session>/<seq>.cert.json` |
| Binding hook | `write_cert_with_binding` (always on emit) | `evidence/logs/sidecar.jsonl` (`evidence_v01_binding`) |
| Platform services | evidence-service, replay-service | Out of bundle scope unless explicitly packaged |

## Artifact binding

Binding events record:

- `session_id`, `cert_path`
- `artifact_digests.cert-v1` (SHA-256 of the written CERT file)
- Optional `evidence_bundle_ref` (only when `EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_REF` is set)

CERT-V1 itself is **not modified**. Full v0.1 bundles are assembled separately via `pf evidence bundle pack`.

## Trust assumptions

- Sidecar process integrity and filesystem write permissions
- CERT-V1 schema validation at write time (external schema required)
- Digest computation over bytes actually written to disk
- Bundle references are opaque paths unless validated by `pf evidence validate --strict`

## Enforcement boundary

Runtime binding records **what the sidecar emitted** and **optional cross-links** to bundle manifests. It does **not**:

- Prove policy correctness
- Prove proof soundness
- Aggregate multi-session evidence automatically
- Replace PCS admission or SWE-bench evidence writers

## What is recorded

- CERT-V1 payloads (existing behavior)
- Optional `evidence_v01_binding` JSONL with schema version `0.1`
- Cert file digest under role `cert-v1`

## What is not recorded

- Full claim/proof/trace artifacts (unless packaged into bundles separately)
- TRACE-REPLAY-KIT execution output (unless referenced in a bundle)
- Cross-tenant bundle aggregation
- DSSE signature verification state beyond CERT `sig` field presence (see [attestation signatures](../specs/evidence-attestation-signatures.md))

## What validation proves

`pf evidence validate --strict` on a v0.1 bundle proves:

- Schema conformance for the bundle manifest
- Referenced artifact presence and byte digests
- Self-consistent `bundle_digest`

Binding JSONL alone is **not** validated by the bundle validator unless included as bundle artifacts.

## What validation does not prove

- Runtime binding events were emitted for every cert
- CERT signatures are valid DSSE envelopes
- Replay determinism of external systems
- Science-claim admission (PCS domain)

## Failure modes

- Invalid CERT: deny-wins via existing `validate_cert` (cert not written)
- Binding write failure after cert write: cert remains; binding may be absent
- Missing `external/CERT-V1` schema: validation and emit tests fail closed; run `make submodules`

## Tamper semantics

Tampering CERT bytes after write invalidates `artifact_digests.cert-v1` in a subsequent binding event only if rebinding occurs. Bundle-level tamper detection requires `pf evidence validate --strict` on the packaged bundle.

## Replay relationship

Runtime binding does not execute replay. Bundles that include `execution-trace` artifacts may be checked with `pf evidence replay`. See [Replay guarantees](replay-guarantees.md).

## Operational guidance

1. Clone `external/CERT-V1` before running sidecar in strict environments.
2. Set `EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_REF` when linking emissions to a known bundle manifest path.
3. Package certs and traces into v0.1 bundles with `pf evidence bundle pack`.
4. Validate bundles before archival: `pf evidence validate <bundle> --strict`.

## Runtime E2E verification authority

Deliverable D3 (runtime integration) is verified on **Linux CI** as the authoritative path when local Windows hosts cannot reach crates.io or lack sidecar build prerequisites.

| Check | Local command | CI authority |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Rust emit integration | `cargo test -p sidecar-watcher -- emit_evidence` | Covered indirectly via Evidence smoke pytest |
| Linux sidecar binding | `pytest tests/runtime_evidence/test_runtime_evidence_sidecar.py -q` | [Evidence smoke 27616315269](https://github.com/SentinelOps-CI/provability-fabric/actions/runs/27616315269) job `smoke` |

**Windows caveat:** `cargo test` may fail with `CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK` or other schannel SSL errors when fetching crates.io. This does not block evidence acceptance when the Linux smoke job above is green on the same commit family.

**Acceptance wording:**

> Runtime evidence binding is demonstrated by the sidecar emit integration test and Linux pytest path in Evidence v0.1 smoke CI. Local `cargo test emit_evidence` is recommended on Linux/macOS; Windows maintainers may defer to CI authority when network or SSL blocks crate downloads.
