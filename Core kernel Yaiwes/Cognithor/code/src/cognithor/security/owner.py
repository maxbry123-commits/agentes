"""Owner-token identification for Trace-UI gating.

The owner is identified by a string match between the bootstrap-token's
user identifier and either:
  - The `COGNITHOR_OWNER_USER_ID` environment variable (preferred), or
  - A fallback derived from `pyproject.toml [project] authors[0].name`, or
  - As a last resort, a hardcoded `"Alexander Söllner"` (the original repo
    author).

The two fallback layers exist so single-user dev installs work out of the box
without configuration. **Production deployments must set
`COGNITHOR_OWNER_USER_ID` explicitly** — `check_owner_security_posture()`
returns the current source and lets the caller fail or warn. Startup code
that wires the Trace-UI calls it in production mode and refuses to bind
public-facing routes when the source is `"hardcoded_fallback"`.
