"""ARC-AGI-3 Frame Analyzer — tracks objects and movement patterns in game frames.

Analyzes 64x64 color-indexed grids to detect:
- Moving regions (objects that change position between frames)
- Static regions (background/terrain)
- Action effects (which actions cause which movements)
- Progress signals (moving toward unexplored areas)
