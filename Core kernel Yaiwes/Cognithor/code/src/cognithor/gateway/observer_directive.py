"""Gateway-side handling of Observer-issued PGE re-loop directives.

The Observer audit may return a ``PGEReloopDirective`` when it detects that a
tool call was missed (``tool_ignorance`` failure). The Gateway catches this
signal after ``Planner.formulate_response()`` and decides whether to:

- re-enter the full PGE loop with the Observer feedback injected, OR
- downgrade to response-regen only (when the directive is a duplicate of one
  already seen this session, or when the PGE iteration budget is exhausted).

This module is pure — no gateway state is touched here, only the per-session
state dict passed in by the caller.
