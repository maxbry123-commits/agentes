"""Program-tree representation used by the enumerative search (spec §6.2).

A program is a typed tree of DSL primitive applications, leafed by either
``InputRef`` (the task's input grid) or ``Const`` (a literal value such
as a color index).

Every node is frozen / immutable. Equality is structural so the
observational-equivalence pruner can use programs directly as keys.
``stable_hash`` returns a SHA-256 over the canonical source form so the
hash is portable across Python versions and processes (the sandbox
worker re-hashes for cache validation).
