"""Sprint-12 — FrameAnalyzer (lifted from cognithor.arc.frame_analyzer).

Learns per-action movement signatures from successive frames so the
agent can build a model of what each ACTIONx button actually does.
This is critical for keyboard-controlled games where ARC-AGI-3 does
not announce which action is "up", "down", "left", "right" — the
agent has to discover that mapping from observed pixel motion.

Usage::

    fa = FrameAnalyzer()
    fa.analyze(grid_t0, action=None)        # bootstrap
    fa.analyze(grid_t1, action="ACTION3")   # records "ACTION3 → down"
    summary = fa.get_action_summary()
    # → {"ACTION3": {"avg_pixels": 2, "avg_direction_row": +1, "count": 1, ...}}

The Wave-3 :class:`EpisodeMemory`/:class:`ChangeDetector` already
counts pixel-changes; FrameAnalyzer is the structured cousin that
also remembers direction + region, so an LLM-driven decoder can be
told "ACTION3 has historically moved your sprite downward" instead of
just "ACTION3 changed 2 pixels".

Stateless across game-switches; carries learned action effects across
levels of the same game (the operator calls
:meth:`reset_for_new_level` on level transitions).
