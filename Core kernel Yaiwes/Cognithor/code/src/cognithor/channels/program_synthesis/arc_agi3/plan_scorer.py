"""Sprint-19 Hebel L — deterministic plan-quality scorer.

Single-LLM-call planning is greedy: the model emits whatever sequence
its temperature=0 greedy decode produces. We have no way to tell
whether it's a *good* plan vs a *plausible-looking but losing* plan.

This module gives a **post-hoc deterministic score** that any plan
candidate can be evaluated against, using nothing but the
``EpisodeMemory`` + ``FrameAnalyzer`` (already wired in our agents).
The score is heuristic — not a real game simulator — but it's enough
to penalise the obvious failure modes we've seen:

* PURE-REPETITION plans (same action 5×): low score
* ACTION6-with-no-coords plans: low score (Sprint-17 finding)
* DEAD/saturated-action plans: low score (Sprint-16 finding)
* High pixΔ-monotonic-growth plans: medium-low (Sprint-18 finding —
  these usually end in GAME_OVER)
* Diverse + uses TARGETED ACTION6 (with x/y data) + has reasoning: high

Designed to be cheap (microseconds) so a generator that produces
K=3-5 candidate plans can score them all and pick the best, without
extra LLM calls. The downstream agent gets the highest-scoring plan
to execute.
