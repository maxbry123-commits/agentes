"""Sprint-19 — Structured state rendering for the LLM prompt.

The single biggest gap in Sprint-15..18: the LLM gets the raw 64×64
ASCII grid + an action history with pixel-counts, but it has NO way
to know:

* Which pixels changed since the last action (only the count)
* What the cluster structure of the current grid is
* Where the cursor is (for click-actions)
* Whether the latest delta moved the agent closer to or further from
  a goal (it can't see "vorher vs jetzt" side-by-side)

ASCII-grid alone is essentially noise to a 27B LLM that hasn't been
trained on this representation. This module gives the LLM three
structured signals:

1. ``render_cluster_summary(grid)`` — one short line per non-background
   colour with cluster count, total pixel count, and centroid of the
   largest cluster ("color 4: 3 clusters totalling 187 cells, biggest
   at (32, 14) size 89").

2. ``render_delta_summary(prev_grid, curr_grid)`` — what the latest
   action *did* in semantic terms ("color 4 grew by 24 cells,
   color 7 shrank by 19 cells, cursor moved from (12, 8) to (12, 9)").

3. ``render_state_changes_in_window(window)`` — per-step delta-summaries
   over the last N memory entries, so the LLM sees the *trajectory*
   of structural change, not just action names + raw pixel counts.

These are deterministic Python — no LLM-side compute, no training. The
LLM still does the strategic reasoning, but on inputs it can actually
parse.
