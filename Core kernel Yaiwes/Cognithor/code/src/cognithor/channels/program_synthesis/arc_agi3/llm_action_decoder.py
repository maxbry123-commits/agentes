"""Sprint-11 Wave-5 — LLM-driven action decoder.

The Wave-5 :class:`LLMActionDecoder` replaces Wave-4's heuristic
"least-tried action" policy with an LLM call: per frame, format a
prompt that describes the current grid + recent history + available
actions, ask the LLM which action to take, and return the
LLM-suggested action.

The actual LLM call is injected as a ``prompt_to_choice`` callable.
This keeps the decoder synchronous (mandatory — the upstream
``Agent.choose_action`` is sync) AND testable (tests pass a stub
callable that returns deterministic choices). A production factory
:func:`build_vllm_choice_fn` wraps a Sprint-10 :class:`VLLMBackend`
into the right shape, doing the async-in-sync via :func:`asyncio.run`.

Without a running vLLM server, the production factory fails fast on
the first call; the decoder then falls back to its Wave-4
:class:`DSLActionDecoder` policy if a fallback is configured. This
mirrors Sprint-10 Track B's hardware-gated wiring.
