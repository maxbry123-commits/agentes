"""Sprint-15 — MTP (multi-token prediction) speculative-decoding stats.

When ``build_inprocess_vllm_*_choice_fn`` is given a ``speculative_config``,
vLLM runs draft-and-verify inside ``LLM.generate``: each forward pass
emits up to ``num_speculative_tokens`` candidate tokens that the
larger model verifies. Tokens that match are accepted in a single
forward pass — the practical speedup depends on **acceptance rate**
(fraction of drafts that survive verification).

Without instrumentation we can't tell whether MTP is paying off:

* High acceptance (≥ 0.7) → near the theoretical 1.9× decode lift.
* Low acceptance (< 0.3) → drafts are wrong half the time, the
  speculative pass is wasted compute.

vLLM exposes spec-decoding stats two ways:

1. **Per-request:** ``RequestOutput.metrics.spec_token_acceptance_counts``
   (vLLM 0.20+; tuple of len ``num_speculative_tokens+1`` showing how
   many tokens were accepted at each draft position).
2. **Per-engine cumulative:** ``LLM.llm_engine.get_metrics()`` →
   list of ``Metric`` objects including
   ``vllm:spec_decode_num_drafts_total``,
   ``vllm:spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total``,
   ``vllm:spec_decode_num_emitted_tokens_total``.

This module ships :class:`MTPStats`, a sticky aggregator that polls
either source and exposes a clean :meth:`acceptance_rate` plus
:meth:`spec_token_efficiency` (accepted-emitted ratio).

The poll is **non-invasive** and **safe** — if MTP isn't configured
or the metrics aren't accessible, ``acceptance_rate`` returns ``None``
and the caller can ignore.
