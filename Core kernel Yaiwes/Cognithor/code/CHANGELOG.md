## [Unreleased]

## [0.99.0] — 2026-05-06 — "Resilient Workflow Engine"

A single-feature release shipping the **Cognithor Resilient Workflow Engine
(CRWE)** — a transactional batch task runner with crash-recovery, signal-
safety, and audit-chain integration. Builds on v0.98.0 "Compliance-Spring"
by extending the same hash-chained audit guarantees from autonomous
Reflector writes to operator-driven batch workflows.

### Added — CRWE (PR #499)

- **`cognithor.core.workflow.WorkflowRunner`** — JSONL-streaming task runner
  with per-task `flush() + os.fsync()` on `results.jsonl` (the "max 1 task
  lost on power-fail" guarantee) plus modulo-N atomic `.checkpoint.json`
  writes (default N=12, configurable via `--checkpoint-every`). Crash-
  recovery uses `results.jsonl` line count as source-of-truth, not the
  checkpoint pointer.

- **Concurrency safety** via `.checkpoint.lock` (POSIX `fcntl.flock` /
  Windows `msvcrt.locking`). Second runner against the same workflow_id
  raises `WorkflowAlreadyRunning(pid, started_at)` instead of silently
  fighting over `results.jsonl`.

- **Signal handling** — `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` register an
  emergency-checkpoint handler that sets a flag the run-loop checks
  *between* tasks; in-flight tasks complete cleanly before exit.
  Async-cancellation-safe via `asyncio.Event`.

- **Resume integrity** — on `--resume`, the runner validates: schema
  version of `.checkpoint.json`, sha256 of manifest matches first-run
  fingerprint (gap-injection detection), sha256 of `results.jsonl` matches
  `checksum_of_results`, line count matches `last_successful_index + 1`.
  Mismatch raises `CheckpointIntegrityError` / `ResultsOutOfSyncError` /
  `ManifestTamperError` with both observed and expected hashes.

- **Audit-chain integration** — every checkpoint emits
  `system_checkpoint_created` via `AuditLogger.log_system` with
  `{"workflow_id", "index", "results_sha256", "elapsed_ms_since_last_checkpoint"}`.
  Resume emits `workflow_resumed` with manifest+results sha256s. Closes
  the gap-injection attack vector — operator can prove from the audit
  chain that they didn't tamper with results.jsonl while offline. Routes
  via `AuditCategory.SYSTEM` (operational state, not autonomous learning
  — distinct from the `REFLECTION` channel from PR #494).

- **`cognithor task <manifest.jsonl>`** CLI subcommand (argparse, follows
  the existing `agent`/`receipt`/`models` pattern). Flags:
  - `--results-dir PATH` (default `~/.cognithor/workflows/<workflow_id>/`)
  - `--resume`
  - `--checkpoint-every N` (default 12, ≥ 1)
  - `--workflow-id ID` (override auto-gen — auto = `{manifest_stem}_{sha8}_{YYYYMMDD}`)
  - `--handler MODULE:FUNCTION` (Python entry-point reference, e.g.
    `cognithor.handlers.echo:run`; supports both sync and async via
    `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` + `loop.run_in_executor` fallback)

- **Manifest pre-flight validation** — walks the JSONL once at start;
  aggregates ALL parse failures + duplicate `task_id`s into a single
  `ManifestValidationError(failures: list[(line_no, reason)])`. No silent
  dedupe — explicit refusal so the operator decides whether to fix the
  manifest or accept duplicates intentionally.

### Tests

- `tests/test_core/test_workflow.py`: 28 collected, **26 passed + 2
  POSIX-only-skipped on Windows** (`test_sigint_mid_batch`,
  `test_sigterm_same_behavior` — `os.kill(pid, SIGINT)` semantics
  unreliable in-process on Windows; the harder property is covered by
  the next item).
- **Crash-recovery integration test**: `subprocess.Popen` spawns a child
  running 50 tasks, sends `SIGKILL` after ≥30 markers, fresh runner
  resumes with `--resume`, asserts exactly 50 unique entries in
  `results.jsonl` and zero duplicates. **PASSES on Windows** (the
  hardest path — TerminateProcess equivalent).

### Coverage continuity

- Test wave 4 (v0.98.0) closed Flutter 27/27 providers + 45/45 screens.
  v0.99.0 maintains those + adds 28 new test_workflow tests on top.
  Total backend tests: ~18,217 passing on Ubuntu-py3.13.

## [0.98.0] — 2026-05-06 — "Compliance-Spring"

A four-PR audit-completeness suite plus a nightly regression-protection
workflow, riding on top of 12 test-coverage PRs that closed long-standing
gaps. Builds on v0.97.0 "Operational Trust" by transforming the reflective
learning path of the agent from "best-effort prose into a free-form log"
into "every autonomous memory write produces a structured, hash-chained,
encrypted-at-rest audit event".

### Added — Compliance-Spring (PRs #494, #496, #495, #497, #498)

- **PR-A — Reflector audit-event helper.** New `AuditCategory.REFLECTION` +
  `AuditLogger.log_reflection_event(action, payload, *, session_id, agent_name)`
  domain channel, separating autonomous Reflector activity from `MEMORY_OP`.
  Helper `Reflector._emit_reflection_audit_event(event_type, payload)`
  computes NFC-normalised SHA-256 over the canonical-JSON payload and
  routes via the new domain method (matching the existing
  `_last_hash_for_file` recipe for cross-tool consistency).
  `CausalAnalyzer.record_sequence` is now atomic-with-audit-emit via
  `with conn:` — no DB INSERT lands without its audit event, no audit
  event lands without its row. (#494)

- **PR-B — WeightOptimizer encrypted snapshots + upstream-fix.**
  Search-ranking weights are now snapshotted at
  `~/.cognithor/weight_snapshots/` as Fernet-encrypted `.fernet` files
  (content-addressed by SHA-256 over plaintext canonical-JSON) plus
  plaintext `.meta.json` sidecars (so receipt verifiers can confirm
  existence + chain link without key access). The pre-existing hardcoded
  `channel_contributions = {"vector": 0.5, "bm25": 0.3, "graph": 0.2}`
  workaround in `reflector.py` is gone — real per-channel shares are now
  computed from `MemorySearchResult.{bm25,vector,graph}_score`. (#496)

- **PR-C — Hypothesis property tests for audit-completeness.** Eight
  properties asserting audit-chain invariants: 1:1 correspondence between
  Reflector autonomous writes and REFLECTION events, canonical-form parity
  with the `_last_hash_for_file` convention, NFC idempotency under
  compatibility-ideograph round-trips, hash determinism across dict
  insertion order, hash-chain validity preserved after reflection-event
  appends. (#495)

- **PR-D — Sink Stabilizer.** Three remaining autonomous Reflector sinks
  (`_write_episodic`, `_write_semantic`, `_write_procedural`) now emit
  REFLECTION events with structured `parameters` payloads.
  `procedure_auto_created` includes a `learned_text_sha256` provenance hash
  — every auto-created procedure is cryptographically tied to the session
  that birthed it (closes the "Geister-Prozeduren"-loophole for
  regulators). `MIGRATION_LEDGER` advances the `audit_log` chain head
  from `v1-hashchain-jsonl` → `v2-reflection-completeness`. xfail in
  `TestWritesEmitAuditEvents` now passes. (#497)

- **Nine REFLECTION event types live**: `causal_sequence_recorded`,
  `causal_skipped_empty_sequence`, `weight_snapshot_persisted`,
  `episodic_appended`, `episodic_skipped_empty_summary`,
  `semantic_facts_extracted`, `semantic_skipped_empty_facts`,
  `procedure_auto_created` (with `learned_text_sha256`),
  `procedure_skipped_no_candidate`. Skip-events are non-negotiable so the
  audit chain proves *"Reflector ran, decided not to persist"* instead of
  going silent.

- **Nightly burn-in workflow** — `.github/workflows/nightly-burn-in.yml`
  runs `scripts/burn_in_compliance_spring.py` daily at 03:00 UTC against an
  isolated `$RUNNER_TEMP/cognithor-burnin/` home dir (50 synthetic PGE-runs,
  ~1s wall time). Fails on any RED metric verdict (snapshot storage,
  audit-emit failures, atomic rollbacks). Uploads JSON report as artifact
  (30-day retention). Also exposes the script as a reproducible local
  smoke-test via `--home <path>` flag. (#498)

### Added — Test Waves (Coverage Closure, ~545 new tests)

12 PRs closing long-standing coverage gaps across backend, Flutter, VS-Code,
and cognithor-packs:

- **Flutter providers**: 27/27 covered (was 23/27). PR #492 added
  `chat_provider`, `config_provider`, `device_provider`, `voice_provider`
  (39 tests).
- **Flutter top-level screens**: 45/45 covered (was 39/45). Smoke + 5
  daily-driver deep-interaction PRs (#484, #489, #490, #491).
- **VS-Code extension**: 5 of 6 source files unit-tested (extension.ts
  entry-point intentional gap — pure wiring, no testable seams). PRs #485
  (cost_gutter + decision_hover, test infra), #487 (receipt_view +
  ws_client + mcp_bridge).
- **Backend deep tests**: agent_vault + post_processing (#486, 99 tests),
  message_handler + pge_loop (#488, 98 tests), mcp/browser +
  mcp/database_tools (#493, 142 tests against SSRF/SQL-injection
  surfaces).
- **cognithor-packs**: lead-hunter + research packs deepened (PR #8 in the
  packs repo, +62 tests).
- **8 stateful Flutter config sub-pages** smoke-tested via populated-cfg
  fixtures (#484).

### Fixed

- `CausalAnalyzer` opened `db/causal_burn_in.db` before the `db/` parent
  directory was created on fresh-home installs. Surfaced by the burn-in
  script's `--home` isolation flag; only worked previously because real
  `~/.cognithor/db/` already existed. (#498)
- Pre-existing `tests/security_contracts/test_inv2_gatekeeper_fails_closed.py`
  fuzz-test asserted unknown-tool case-sensitivity but Gatekeeper case-folds
  via `.lower()`. Hypothesis would eventually find `'SHELL'` (which folds
  into the green-list `'shell'`) and falsify; now case-folds the
  comparison side. (#488)

## [0.97.0] — 2026-05-04 — "Operational Trust"

A reviewer-feedback-driven release that closes Cognithor's "post-mortem
reconstruction" gap. Every audit-relevant decision the agent makes is now
captured as a structured, queryable, signed receipt — not as free-form log
strings. 42 PRs (#395–#437), ~10 500 LOC, ~330 new tests, 0 regressions,
mypy --strict + ruff clean across the new surface.

The canonical reference for the stack is **`docs/operational_trust.md`**
(298 lines, TRUST-1..10).

### Added — TRUST-1 Run Receipts

- `cognithor.audit.AuditLogger.run_receipt(run_id, *, include_trust, signing_key)`
  — aggregates every audit entry for a run into a deterministic JSON bundle
  with optional HMAC-SHA-256 signature. (#403)
- `AuditLogger.verify_receipt_signature(bundle, signing_key)` — round-trip
  verification of persisted bundles. (#403)
- Append-only audit hash chain (each entry seals the previous SHA-256), so
  receipts surface tamper events explicitly. (#373, #422)
- `cognithor receipt show / verify / list / export-all / diff` — five CLI
  subcommands for operator post-mortems. `show` dumps a single bundle (with
  optional `--include-trust --sign-key`); `verify` validates a stored bundle;
  `list` enumerates known run-ids; `export-all` writes every bundle for a
  date-range to disk; `diff` produces a structural diff between two
  bundles. (#404, #424, #430, #431)
- `GET /api/crew/trace/{trace_id}/receipt?include_trust=true` — REST
  surface, owner-token gated, returns the same bundle shape as the CLI. (#405)

### Added — TRUST-2 Decision Explanations

- `DecisionExplanation` (frozen dataclass) carries `rule_id`, `rule_source`,
  and `matched_pattern` (truncated to 200 chars). Attached to every
  Gatekeeper block path (12 sites) so downstream tools can render a
  structured "why we said no" instead of parsing prose. (#396, #415, #418,
  #419, #422, #423, #428, #429)

### Added — TRUST-3 Failure-Mode Taxonomy

- `FailureMode` `StrEnum` with 15 canonical values (9 baseline + 6 added
  this release: `policy_block`, `quota_exceeded`, `tool_timeout`,
  `parse_error`, `dependency_missing`, `pack_eula_missing`). Aggregated
  per-run via `AuditLogger.failure_mode_summary(run_id)`. (#403, #421)

### Added — TRUST-4 Pack Rollback

- `cognithor pack rollback <id> [--to-version VER]` — restores a pack to a
  prior version and seals the rollback into the audit chain. Pre-flight
  validates the target version is locally cached; otherwise refuses. (#108
  task closure)

### Added — TRUST-5..10 Operational Trust Stack

The bulk of this release. Six independent ledgers, all frozen-dataclass +
`StrEnum` + append-only + JSON-serialisable, all wired through every
relevant capture site:

- **TRUST-5 Provenance** — `cognithor.memory.provenance.ProvenanceLedger`.
  9 memory-tier capture sites: semantic-store add/remove (#409, #411),
  episodic-store append (#410), agent-vault put/delete (#412, #420),
  procedural memory write (#425), core-memory replace (#426), knowledge
  ingest enqueue/dequeue (#433), indexer rebuild (#435). Each tag carries
  `source_type`, `source_id`, `expiry_policy`, and the canonical timestamp.
  Both `source_type` and `source_id` are required; partial args skip the
  tag rather than fail; unknown source types coerce to `SourceType.UNKNOWN`.
  Capture is best-effort and never raises into the calling tier. (#397)
- **TRUST-6 Permission Scopes** — `cognithor.security.permission_scope`
  with `PermissionScope` + `ScopeAxis` + `ScopeRegistry`. Encodes
  least-privilege per axis (filesystem, network, llm, tool). (#395)
- **TRUST-7 Tool Fingerprints** — `cognithor.security.fingerprint` with
  `ToolFingerprint` + `BinaryKind` (`TOOL`, `PACK`, `MODEL`, `SCHEMA`,
  `BINARY`). 4 of 5 kinds captured automatically — MCP tools (#407), packs
  (#408), models (#413, #414), MCP schemas (#427). `BINARY` capture is
  hardware-gated and shipped behind a feature flag. (#398)
- **TRUST-8 Cloud-Escalation** — `cognithor.security.cloud_escalation`
  with `EscalationEvent` + `EscalationReason`. Metadata-only privacy
  contract: ledger entries record _that_ a cloud call happened, never
  the prompt or response. Backend-side dispatch wiring deferred to a
  follow-up. (#399)
- **TRUST-9 Cost Ledger** — `cognithor.security.cost_ledger` with
  `CostEntry` + `CostKind` and `BudgetReport`. Canonical unit is integer
  micro-USD (no float rounding drift). Wired through the provenance tags
  on every memory write. (#401)
- **TRUST-10 Migration Ledger** — `cognithor.security.migration_ledger`
  with `MigrationStep` + `MigrationDomain` + `MigrationStatus`. Per-domain
  chain integrity, so a corrupt audit entry in one domain doesn't poison
  the others. Self-audit recorders shipped for 7 self-audit domains
  (#416, #417, #432, #434).

### Added — Glue & surface

- `cognithor.security.trust_bundle.build_trust_bundle(run_id)` — composer
  that folds all six ledgers into a single canonical receipt block. (#402)
- `cognithor.security.trust_wiring` — module-level recorders consumed by
  capture sites under `contextlib.suppress(Exception)`. (#406)
- `docs/operational_trust.md` — canonical 298-line reference doc covering
  every TRUST tier, capture-site matrix, and operator runbook. (#436)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-sprint27-ide-integration.md` —
  forward-looking plan for the VS-Code / JetBrains / Cursor extension
  family that consumes the receipt API. (#437)

### Notes

- Disk persistence of TRUST ledgers (SQLCipher) is in-memory-only this
  release; persistence + retention windows ship in 0.98.x.
- TRUST-7 `BINARY`-kind capture and TRUST-8 backend-dispatch wiring
  are scaffolded but feature-flagged; no operator-visible regression if
  they remain off.
- `Flutter TrustBundlePanel` UI widget is queued for a follow-up release;
  the CLI + REST surfaces are the supported entry points today.

## [0.96.0] — 2026-05-01 — "ARC-AGI-3 Pass"

### Added — PSE Phase-2 ARC-AGI-3 capability

- **100 % success on the committed `cognithor_bench/arc_agi3` corpus** (20 tasks: 8 train + 4 held-out + 8 hard). Up from 75 % in v0.95.0. Reproduce: `python -m cognithor.channels.program_synthesis.synthesis.arc_baseline_runner --subset hard`.
- Five new object-level DSL primitives (registry 61 → 66): `tile_3x`, `remove_singletons`, `count_components`, `recolor_by_component_size`, `unique_colors_diagonal`.
- ARC-AGI-3 corpus loader (`synthesis/arc_corpus.py`) — accepts canonical ARC schema, manifest-driven subset filtering, SHA-256 corpus pinning for CI drift detection.
- Sprint-7 cascade-generalisation runner — exhaustive 1-3 step composition of unary primitives + 2-step recolor cascades.

### Added — Phase-2 production wiring

- `synthesis/wired_engine.py` (`WiredPhase2Engine`) — Phase-1 ↔ Phase-2 async adapter (EnumerativeSearch + Refiner pipeline + verifier).
- `synthesis/benchmark_runner.py` `--phase2` flag for A/B comparison; `--arc-corpus PATH --arc-subset NAME` to target any ARC corpus.
- `phase2/verifier_evaluator.py` — end-to-end 5-factor verifier (demo_pass / partial_pixel / invariants / triviality / suspicion).
- 20-Task Leak-Free fixture set + nightly cron (`.github/workflows/pse-phase2-benchmark.yml`, daily 03:00 UTC, ≥ 10 PP regression gate).

### Fixed

- `tests/test_security/test_tls_config.py` — replaced `subprocess.run(["openssl", ...])` with in-process `cryptography` library. Eliminates 11 occasional Win-py3.12 failures observed in 16 000-test single-process full-repo runs.

### Score trajectory (cognithor_bench/arc_agi3 hard subset)

| Stage | Approach | Score |
|---|---|---|
| v0.95.0 baseline | Phase-1 EnumerativeSearch alone | 12.5 % |
| Sprint-5 | + WiredPhase2Engine local-edit | 12.5 % |
| Sprint-6 | + Symbolic-Repair recolor cascade | 25.0 % |
| Sprint-7 | + Generalised unary-chain cascade | 50.0 % |
| **v0.96.0** | **+ 5 object-level DSL primitives** | **100.0 %** |

### Removed

- `src/cognithor/benchmark/` archived to `archive/cognithor_internal_benchmark/` (in-process framework, ~863 LOC). Canonical benchmark home is the top-level `cognithor_bench/` package.
- `tests/test_benchmark/` archived; no longer in CI.

## [0.95.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added — Trace-UI

- `cognithor.crew.trace_bus.TraceBus` — in-process pub/sub for crew audit events. Hooks `compiler.append_audit()` to live-broadcast crew_* events via lifecycle stream + per-trace topic subscriptions. Backpressure: drop-oldest at 1000-event queue cap. (WP1)
- `cognithor.security.owner.require_owner()` — owner-token gating for Trace-UI surfaces. Reads `COGNITHOR_OWNER_USER_ID` env var with `pyproject.toml` author-name fallback. (WP1)
- Three FastAPI endpoints under `/api/crew/`: `traces` (list with status/since/limit filters), `trace/{id}` (full events), `trace/{id}/stats` (aggregates). Owner-gated via `X-Cognithor-User` header. Reads `~/.cognithor/logs/audit.jsonl` directly with corruption-tolerant parsing. (WP2)
- WebSocket message types `crew_lifecycle_subscribe`, `crew_subscribe`, `crew_unsubscribe` for live Crew event streaming. Owner-gated; non-owner subscribes receive `{type:"error", code:"owner_only"}` and are ignored. Disconnect auto-cleans all subscriptions. Outbound frames: `{type:"crew_lifecycle", payload:<event>}` and `{type:"crew_event", payload:<event>}`. (WP3)
- Flutter Trace-UI: `TraceListScreen` (master) + `TraceDetailScreen` (detail) with vertical timeline-log + stats sidebar (per-agent token breakdown, guardrail summary, elapsed). REST-fetch on open, WebSocket subscribe for live updates, auto-cleanup on unpin/disconnect. (WP4)
- AutoGen-Shim coverage — `cognithor.compat.autogen.AssistantAgent.run()` verified to route through `cognithor.crew.Crew`, so AutoGen-shim runs surface in Trace-UI. (WP5)
- New i18n keys: `navTraces`, `traceStatus*`, `traceFilter*`, `traceEmpty`, `traceNotFound` (en + de + ar + zh).
- `docs/api/crew-traces.md` — endpoint reference.

## [0.94.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed — v0.94.0 hotfix

- `[autogen]` extra (root + `cognithor_bench`) now also pins
  `autogen-ext[openai]==0.7.5`. Without it, `cognithor-bench --adapter autogen`
  raised a misleading ImportError because `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` lives
  in `autogen-ext`, not `autogen-agentchat`. Updated the adapter's error hint
  accordingly. Surfaced by post-release dry-run audit (`docs/superpowers/reports/2026-04-26-v094-dry-run-audit.md` — BUG-1, HIGH).
- `docs/integrations/catalog.json` no longer lists `sevdesk_get_invoice` and
  `sevdesk_list_contacts`. The sevDesk MCP module uses a no-op `@mcp_tool`
  marker decorator and is not yet wired into the live MCP server, so the
  catalog over-promised capability. The generator script
  (`scripts/generate_integrations_catalog.py`) now has an explicit
  `NOT_YET_REGISTERED_PREFIXES` filter — re-add `cognithor.mcp.sevdesk` to
  the catalog automatically when the connector lands. (BUG-2, MEDIUM.)
- `insurance-agent-pack run --interview` no longer renders `§34d` as
  mojibake on Windows consoles. CLI now reconfigures `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr`
  to UTF-8 on `win32` at entry. (BUG-3, LOW.)

## [0.94.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added — AutoGen Strategy Adoption

- `cognithor.compat.autogen` — source-compatibility shim for
  `autogen-agentchat==0.7.5` (WP2). Search-and-replace import
  migration from AutoGen-AgentChat to Cognithor; 1-shot path uses
  `cognithor.crew`, multi-round path uses a 250-LOC `_RoundRobinAdapter`.
  Supported: `AssistantAgent`, `RoundRobinGroupChat`, message + termination
  classes, `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` wrapper. Not supported by design:
  `SelectorGroupChat`, `Swarm`, `MagenticOneGroupChat` (see ADR 0001).
- `cognithor_bench/` — reproducible Multi-Agent benchmark scaffold (WP4).
  CLI: `cognithor-bench run|tabulate`. Default adapter: Cognithor; opt-in
  AutoGen adapter via `pip install cognithor[autogen]`. Bundled smoke
  scenarios under `cognithor_bench/src/cognithor_bench/scenarios/`.
- `examples/insurance-agent-pack/` — DACH insurance pre-advisory reference
  pack (WP3). Standalone `pip install ./examples/insurance-agent-pack/`.
  4 agents (NeedsAssessor, PolicyAnalyst with PDF tool-use, ComplianceGatekeeper
  as visible PGE-demo, ReportGenerator). §34d-NEUTRAL — see DISCLAIMER.md.
- `docs/competitive-analysis/` — comparison docs for AutoGen, MAF, LangGraph, CrewAI (WP1).
- `docs/adr/0001-pge-trinity-vs-group-chat.md` — first Architecture Decision Record (WP5).
- `NOTICE` — AutoGen-MIT attribution under "Third-party attributions".
- `pyproject.toml` — new `[autogen]` extra (`autogen-agentchat==0.7.5`)
  as the single pin-point for v0.94.0's source-compat shim and bench adapter.
- `pyproject.toml` `[dev]` extra — registers `insurance-agent-pack` editable.

## [0.93.0] -- 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`cognithor.crew` — Crew-Layer (Feature 1 of v1.0 adoption)** — high-level
  declarative Multi-Agent API on top of PGE-Trinity. `CrewAgent`, `CrewTask`,
  `Crew`, `CrewProcess` (SEQUENTIAL + HIERARCHICAL), plus async kickoff,
  YAML loader, and `@agent` / `@task` / `@crew` method decorators. Every
  execution routes through the existing Planner → Gatekeeper → Executor
  pipeline — no new LLM entry point, no bypass. Audit events emit via the
  Hashline-Guard chain with PII redaction. Trilingual error messages
  (en/de/zh) via `cognithor.i18n`. Spec at
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-cognithor-crew-v1-adoption.md`.
- **`cognithor.crew.guardrails` — Task-Level Guardrails (Feature 4)** — function-
  based + string-based validators, built-in `hallucination_check`, `word_count`,
  `no_pii` (DE-focused), `schema` (Pydantic), plus `chain()` combinator. Failures
  trigger retry-with-feedback up to `task.max_retries`, then raise
  `GuardrailFailure`. Every verdict is recorded in the Hashline-Guard audit chain
  with PII-detection flag.
- **`cognithor init` scaffolder + 5 first-party templates (Feature 3)** —
  `cognithor init <name> --template <name> [--dir PATH] [--lang de|en]`
  generates a runnable Crew project from Jinja2 templates. Templates: `research`,
  `customer-support`, `data-analyst`, `content`, `versicherungs-vergleich`
  (DACH-differentiator, fully offline-capable, §34d-neutral guardrails).
  `cognithor init --list-templates` prints the catalog with DE/EN descriptions.
  CI scaffolds every template on every PR.
- **Integrations Catalog (Feature 7)** — `docs/integrations/catalog.json`
  auto-generated from MCP tool definitions by
  `scripts/generate_integrations_catalog.py`. CI fails on drift. Includes
  a new DACH-specific sevDesk REST connector (v1.0 Launch).
- **Quickstart Documentation (Feature 2)** — `docs/quickstart/` — 8-page
  bilingual (DE primary + EN) walkthrough from install to production. Includes
  5 runnable examples under `examples/quickstart/` (first-crew, first-tool,
  first-skill, guardrails, PKV report). CI smoke-tests every example on every
  PR via `.github/workflows/quickstart-examples.yml`.

### Breaking Changes
None. The Crew-Layer is strictly additive — no existing public API changes.

## [0.92.7] -- 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Video input via vLLM** — attach a local video (`.mp4` / `.webm` / `.mov` / `.mkv` /
  `.avi`) or paste a direct video URL in chat; Qwen3.6-27B (or any vLLM-served
  video-capable VLM) analyzes it end-to-end. Native vLLM `video_url` content
  type — no frame-extraction workarounds. Adaptive frame sampling based on
  duration (fps=3 for clips under 10 s, num_frames=32 for videos over 5 min)
  via `ffprobe`. Single video per chat turn. Local uploads served to vLLM over
  a 127.0.0.1-only HTTP file server. Videos are cleaned up when the chat
  session closes and auto-expire after 24 h. Video requests on a DEGRADED vLLM
  produce a hard error — no silent fallback to Ollama (Ollama has no vision).
  Windows installer now bundles an LGPL-licensed ffmpeg build. See
  `docs/vllm-user-guide.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-design.md`.
- **Flutter URL-einfügen dialog** — paperclip → "URL einfügen" opens an
  AlertDialog for a direct video URL (adds to Decision 1 of the video-input
  spec). Delegates validation to `ChatProvider.handlePastedTextForVideoUrl`.
- **Structured logging for docker run** — `VLLMOrchestrator.start_container`
  emits `log.info("vllm_docker_run_starting", cmd=..., model=..., port=...)`
  before `subprocess.run` and `log.error("vllm_docker_run_failed", ...)` on
  non-zero exit. HF_TOKEN values are redacted. Makes fragile-startup
  debugging possible without a local debugger.

### Changed
- Cognithor now requires Docker Engine ≥ 20.10 when using vLLM on Linux
  (host-gateway flag for `--add-host` was added in 20.10). Docker Desktop
  versions are all fine.
- Flutter paperclip in the chat input is now a popup menu with explicit
  entries for Image / Video / File / URL instead of a single file picker.
- Default `vllm/vllm-openai` image flipped from `v0.19.1` to `cu130-nightly`
  because the tagged release crashes Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 at warmup on SM120;
  the nightly ships the `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` fix. See
  `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-spike-findings.md`.
- `VLLMOrchestrator` now threads the live `VLLMConfig` through both
  construction sites (`backends_api._get_orchestrator` and
  `Gateway.__init__`) so user overrides of `max_model_len`,
  `gpu_memory_utilization`, `cpu_offload_gb`, `enforce_eager` actually
  reach the `docker run` command. Previously both sites fell back to
  `VLLMConfig()` defaults silently.
- Backend code paths unify on a single `VLLMOrchestrator` instance via
  `app.state.vllm_orchestrator`. Previously `backends_api` had its own
  cache, and the UI's "Start vLLM" button hit that second instance which
  never had `media_url` wired — leaving the container unable to fetch
  uploads. Fallback cache retained for standalone-API mode.

### Fixed
- **Video helper preserves text on multi-modal turns** — both
  `_attach_video_to_last_user` and `_attach_images_to_last_user` now
  handle list-form content (a prior image/video attachment in the same
  turn). Previously the text was silently dropped to `""` and the
  model received only the media with no question.
- **Flutter send-button race during upload** — `_pickVideo` now tracks
  `_isUploading`, the Send button becomes a progress indicator, and
  `_submit` short-circuits until the multipart POST completes. Also
  defers the `_isUploading = false` reset to a `WidgetsBinding`
  post-frame callback so the Send tree has rebuilt before the guard
  lifts.
- **ffprobe / ffmpeg no longer block the event loop** — the FastAPI
  `/api/media/upload` handler and the Gateway per-turn handler both
  offload the blocking `subprocess.run` calls via `asyncio.to_thread`.
  Concurrent uploads stop serialising on the uvicorn worker.
- **Path-traversal guard hardened** — `/media/{filename}` endpoints on
  both the Flutter-facing `/api/media/thumb` and the vLLM-facing
  MediaUploadServer now verify `resolved.is_relative_to(media_dir)`
  instead of substring-checking `"/" in filename or ".." in filename`.
  The old guard let `C:%5CWindows%5Csystem32%5Ccmd.exe` through on
  Windows because `pathlib` resolves absolute paths as replacements.
- **Quota TOCTOU** — `MediaUploadServer.save_upload` is now protected by
  a `threading.Lock` over the evict-and-write critical section. Two
  concurrent uploads can no longer both pass the quota check
  independently, leave the dir above quota, and silently accept a
  third party's eviction.
- **Session-close cleanup wired** — `Gateway._cleanup_stale_sessions`
  now dispatches `VideoCleanupWorker.on_session_close(session_id)`
  via `loop.create_task` when a running loop is available. Previously
  the 24 h TTL sweep was the only deletion path; videos from closed
  sessions persisted until then.
- **VideoCleanupWorker.start() is idempotent** — second calls without
  an intervening `stop()` no longer orphan the first sweep task.
- **URL paste filename strips query + fragment** — `clip.mp4?token=abc`
  now derives `filename="clip.mp4"` while the full URL (including
  query/fragment for fetching) remains intact in the pending
  attachment. The regex also now accepts URLs with `?` or `#` after
  the extension — previously it rejected them entirely.
- **chat_stream accepts video kwarg** — `VLLMBackend.chat_stream` now
  threads `video=` through the same way `chat()` does. A future caller
  routing video through the streaming path no longer silently drops
  the attachment.
- **URL-dialog TextEditingController lifecycle** — moved into a
  `_UrlInputDialog` StatefulWidget so its `dispose` runs after the
  dialog's exit animation.
- **KeyboardListener FocusNode lifecycle** — promoted from inline
  `FocusNode()` in `build()` (leaked every rebuild) to a `late final`
  state field initialised in `initState`, disposed in `dispose`.
- **Quota-exceeded recovery hint** — the 507 response for
  `MediaUploadQuotaExceededError` now includes `recovery_hint` so the
  client can surface actionable guidance. Previously the generic
  `MediaUploadError` branch dropped it.

## [0.92.6] -- 2026-04-23

### Added
- **vLLM as opt-in LLM backend** with full Flutter-driven lifecycle (install,
  pull-image, start, stop, hot-switch) — spec at
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-vllm-opt-in-backend-design.md`,
  plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-vllm-opt-in-backend.md`. Ollama
  remains the default — vLLM is purely additive. Unlocks native FP4 on
  Blackwell GPUs (RTX 50xx), FP8 on Ada, AWQ-INT4 on Ampere. Model registry
  carries per-quantization entries with `min_compute_capability` and
  `vram_gb_min` so the UI can disable models that don't fit the detected GPU
  and auto-recommend the best fit. New `LlmBackendsScreen` and
  `VllmSetupScreen` in Flutter. New FastAPI endpoints under
  `/api/backends/vllm/*` including SSE-streamed pull progress. User guide
  at `docs/vllm-user-guide.md`, manual test recipe at
  `docs/vllm-manual-test.md`.

### Fixed
- **Language change in Settings now actually changes the chat response
  language** (closes #136). Reported by @PCAssistSoftware: switching
  Administration → Configuration → Language from German to English still
  produced German chat replies. Root cause: the config-save handler in
  `config_routes.py` was calling `gateway.reload_components(config=True)`
  only — which reloads the config itself but leaves the `Planner`'s cached
  `_system_prompt_template` untouched. The planner had already built its
  template from the German i18n preset (or the hardcoded German fallback
  which literally contains `"Du sprichst Deutsch."`) and continued using
  it for every subsequent LLM call. Now the handler additionally passes
  `prompts=True` when the language field is part of the update, which
  triggers `planner.reload_prompts()` and re-resolves the template from
  the preset chain for the new language. No restart required.

## [0.92.5] -- 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Qwen3.6 model registry + installer** (`cognithor models install <name>`).
  New CLI commands:
    - `cognithor models list` — print all known models grouped by provider.
    - `cognithor models install <name>` — install an Ollama tag (e.g.
      `qwen3.6:35b`) or a community HuggingFace GGUF (e.g.
      `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF`). HF GGUFs are downloaded via
      `huggingface_hub` and imported into the local Ollama via
      `ollama create -f Modelfile`, ending up under the registry's
      `import_as` tag (e.g. `qwen3.6:27b`, matching upstream).
  Model registry gained a `community_gguf` provider section + Qwen3.6
  entries. Registry updated timestamp: 2026-04-22.
- **Vision routing for the Planner**. When `WorkingMemory.image_attachments`
  is non-empty, `Planner.formulate_response()` routes the LLM call through
  `config.vision_model_detail` and passes the image paths to
  `OllamaClient.chat(images=...)`. The Ollama client encodes paths (or
  pre-encoded base64 strings) and attaches them to the last user message
  per Ollama's multimodal chat API.
- **Flutter WebUI image uploads → VLM**. When the user attaches an image
  in the chat input (`chat_input.dart` already supports PNG/JPG/WEBP/...),
  the WebUI backend now:
    - Detects the image MIME from the filename extension.
    - Saves the raw bytes to `~/.cognithor/workspace/uploads/`.
    - Populates `IncomingMessage.attachments` with the path (instead of
      forcing a text-extraction pass that would lose visual context).
  The Gateway filters `msg.attachments` for image extensions and sets
  `WorkingMemory.image_attachments` on the current turn, triggering the
  Planner's vision routing. The chat bubble renders a thumbnail preview
  of uploaded images via `metadata.image_base64`.
- **Latent file-upload bug fix**. The WebUI WebSocket file-upload handler
  previously only fired when `text.startswith("[file_upload]")` — a legacy
  format the current Flutter client has never sent. File uploads from
  Flutter were silently dropped. The gate is now `metadata.file_base64`
  presence, covering the real message shape.

### Fixed
- **`config.yaml` with legacy keys no longer hard-crashes at startup**
  (closes #131). Upgrading users whose `config.yaml` still contains fields
  the current `CognithorConfig` no longer recognizes (e.g. `max_agents`,
  `max_concurrent`, `memory_limit_mb`, `rag`) would hit
  `pydantic_core.ValidationError: extra_forbidden` inside `load_config`
  and be completely unable to launch. `load_config` now catches
  `extra_forbidden` errors from the on-disk YAML read path, strips the
  offending keys, logs a clear WARN listing them, and re-validates once.
  `CognithorConfig` keeps `extra="forbid"` on the model itself so
  programmatic construction in tests still catches typos — only the
  user-supplied YAML is self-healing.

- **Flutter version mismatch overlay blocked the app on every 0.92.x
  installer** (reported on #131 by @PCAssistSoftware). The Flutter
  frontend hard-coded `kFrontendVersion = '0.91.0'` in
  `connection_provider.dart` and `version: 0.91.0+1` in `pubspec.yaml`;
  neither was bumped during the 0.92.x release cadence, so every fresh
  0.92.x install reported itself as 0.91 to the backend, tripped the
  major.minor compatibility check, and wedged users behind the "Version
  Mismatch" overlay with no way out. Both constants are now bumped to
  match `cognithor.__version__` and a new
  `tests/test_flutter_version_sync.py` cross-checks the Flutter version
  against the Python `__version__` so CI fails loudly if a future
  release bump forgets Flutter.

### Deferred
- **Video input** is explicitly deferred. Qwen3.6-27B (VLM) can process
  video frames, but Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint does not support video
  input. End-to-end video would require a direct Transformers/vLLM
  backend — tracked separately.

## [0.92.4] -- 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Local PII redactor** (closes #122). Opt-in regex-based redaction of
  outbound LLM messages. Seven categories — `email`, `phone`, `api_key`
  (OpenAI/Anthropic/GitHub/AWS/Google/Slack/HF), `credit_card` (Luhn-
  validated), `ssn`, `iban`, `private_key` (PEM blocks). Runs inside
  `OllamaClient.chat()` so every LLM call is covered (Planner, Observer,
  Reflector, browser vision). Default-off for backward compat; enable via
  `security.pii_redactor.enabled`. Zero external calls, zero telemetry —
  matches Cognithor's local-first promise. Optional spaCy NER mode reserved
  for later (names/orgs/locations). Co-designed with @teodorofodocrispin-cmyk.

## [0.92.3] -- 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Observer Audit Layer** (#118). New LLM-based response quality check that runs
  after the existing regex-based `ResponseValidator`. Audits every response
  across four dimensions — Hallucination, Sycophancy, Laziness, Tool-Ignorance
  — with per-dimension retry strategies:
    - Hallucination failures trigger response-regeneration inside the Planner.
    - Tool-Ignorance failures trigger a full PGE re-loop via the Gateway.
    - Sycophancy and Laziness are advisory (logged, non-blocking).
  Exhausted retries deliver the response with a `[Quality check flagged issues]`
  prefix. Config: `observer.*` section + `models.observer`. See
  `CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` for all options. Circuit breaker disables the Observer
  after consecutive failures; audit records persist to
  `~/.cognithor/db/observer_audits.db`. Dedicated `qwen3:32b` audit model with
  graceful degraded-mode fallback to the planner model when observer model
  is not installed. 96%+ test coverage on observer modules.
- **Structured skill documentation** (#117, #123, #124). All 5 core SKILL.md
  files upgraded from 3-line stubs to structured docs with YAML frontmatter,
  Steps, Examples, Error Handling, and Troubleshooting tables. External
  contribution from @rohan-tessl.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `Planner.formulate_response()` now returns `ResponseEnvelope`
  (with optional `PGEReloopDirective`) instead of a plain `str`. All in-tree
  callers updated. Downstream integrations must dereference
  `envelope.content`.
- **Complete Jarvis → Cognithor rebrand** (#121, #125, #128):
    - Python: `JarvisConfig` → `CognithorConfig`, `jarvis_home` → `cognithor_home`
      (202 call sites, 159 attribute accesses). Backward-compat aliases added
      in #121 then removed in #125 after confirming zero external consumers.
    - Flutter: `JarvisApp`, `JarvisTheme`, and 15 other widget/service classes
      renamed to `Cognithor*`. 28 source files renamed (`jarvis_*.dart` →
      `cognithor_*.dart`). All 4 ARB i18n files (en/de/ar/zh) + regenerated
      l10n updated. 1635 → 19 remaining refs (backend-contract identifiers
      that require coordinated backend+frontend migration).
    - YAML auto-migration for existing user configs with legacy `jarvis_home:` key.
    - `JARVIS_*` env var prefix still accepted as legacy alias.
- **Documentation sweep** (#119, #126, #129). README, QUICKSTART, FAQ,
  ARCHITECTURE, CHANNELS_GUIDE, DEVELOPER, CONFIG_REFERENCE, TROUBLESHOOTING,
  DATABASE, IDENTITY, and install scripts now show `COGNITHOR_*` env vars,
  paths, and identifiers as primary. Observer mentioned in README status
  table, ARCHITECTURE PGE section, and FAQ.

### Fixed
- **install.sh silently stopped during Flutter check on Arch Linux** (#120,
  closes Reddit feedback item 1). Root cause was `python -c "import jarvis"`
  post-install verify, which failed since the package rename. The subsequent
  `fatal "Installation failed"` exit scrolled past the Flutter output, making
  it look like a Flutter problem.
- **`JARVIS_HOME` / `COGNITHOR_HOME` env vars crashed config load** (#119,
  closes Reddit feedback item 3). Config's `_apply_env_overrides` mapped the
  single-word env var to a rejected `home` field under Pydantic
  `extra="forbid"`. Now correctly aliases to the real `cognithor_home` field.
- **`/config` CLI command crashed with asyncio error** (#120, closes Reddit
  feedback item 4). `prompt_toolkit.prompt()` was called synchronously from
  an async handler. Now wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()`.
- **No auto-config creation on first run** (#120, closes Reddit feedback
  item 5). Transitive fix from item 1: `setup_directories()` runs `cognithor
  --init-only` to materialize `config.yaml`, but only after
  `install_cognithor()` succeeds. Fixing item 1 fixes item 5.
- **`pysqlcipher3` install failed on macOS** (#127, closes #116). Generic
  helper passed Debian package name `libsqlcipher-dev` to brew, which
  fuzzy-matched to the unrelated `libserdes` formula. Now resolves per-PM:
  `libsqlcipher-dev` (apt), `sqlcipher-devel` (dnf), `sqlcipher`
  (pacman/brew).
- **Flaky `test_full_lifecycle` on Windows** (#123). Windows `time.time()` has
  ~15.6ms resolution; a fast-executing recorder lifecycle produces
  `started_at == finished_at`. Changed strict `>` assertion to `>=`.
- **`_call_llm_audit` used wrong kwarg name** (in #121 live tests). Passed
  `format="json"` but `OllamaClient.chat()` expects `format_json=True`.
  Observer was silently failing-open in production. Fixed before first ship.
- **Pre-existing `_migrate_jarvis_home` bug** where `src` and `dst` pointed
  at the same path (migration no-op for users with legacy `~/.jarvis/`).
  Fixed as side effect of the rebrand.

## [0.91.0] -- 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **i18n language selection (#109)** — Installer post-processes `agents.yaml` based on chosen language, planner uses `_FORMULATE_TEMPLATES` dict (de/en) for all response prompts, voice STT channels (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, voice_ws_bridge) honor `config.language`
- **Approval flow** — `_WebUIBridge.request_approval()` no longer auto-approves; sends real `approval_request` over WebSocket and waits for client response (30min timeout)
- **Approval timeout** — Extended from 5min to 30min to accommodate user review time
- **Conversation tree empty** — `conversation_id` and `active_leaf_id` now persisted in session store; `/chat/tree/latest` endpoint accepts session_id query param
- **Chat dark background** — Chat body wrapped in Container with `scaffoldBackgroundColor` to prevent white background in tree view
- **Kanban sqlcipher crash** — `sqlite3.Row` row_factory incompatible with sqlcipher3 cursor; use `sqlcipher3.Row` with `_dict_row_factory` fallback
- **ORANGE approval routing** — Session ID mismatch fixed: gateway's internal session key vs WS client-facing session ID
- **Duplicate evolution plans** — Loop checked for existing plans by goal before creating new ones; cleaned up 323 duplicates
- **Evolution build TypeError** — `SkillGap()` missing required `id` argument prevented all build cycles
- **Gateway evolution goal progress endpoint** — Now reads from GoalManager (live progress) instead of config.yaml (static)
- **Planner refusal on action requests** — Retry with explicit tool-plan hint when LLM self-censors on file/delete operations
- **Config auto-swap** — `model_post_init` no longer overrides explicit `llm_backend_type` setting
- **DB migration** — Auto-migrate `~/.jarvis/` data to `~/.cognithor/` on first start; keyring key fallback; corrupt session DB recovery
- **Chat header "Jarvis"** — Renamed to "Cognithor" in all 4 locales (en/de/zh/ar) and planner system prompt
- **Agent roster** — System prompt lists all 6 available agents (Cognithor, Researcher, Coder, Office, Operator, Frontier)

### Added
- **Live Logs tab** in MonitoringScreen — polls `/api/v1/monitoring/events` every 5s, severity filter chips, auto-scroll with "new events" button
- **Invisible backend** — `cognithor.bat` uses `pythonw.exe` in `--ui` mode, no console window
- **ConnectionGuard overlay** — Blocks UI with non-dismissible overlay when backend unreachable, 15s health polling
- **Agent delegation visibility** — Backend broadcasts delegation status, Flutter shows agent badge on messages
- **Evolution goal edit/delete** — New popup menu entries with confirmation dialog
- **GitHub model list update** — Cognithor installer recommender updated to qwen3.5, llama4, gemma3, devstral (from obsolete qwen2.5, llama3.1)
- **Backend migration on upgrade** — Auto-copies data from legacy `~/.jarvis/` location

## [0.90.0] -- 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Social Listening** — Hacker News + Discord scanners join existing Reddit system
  - `src/cognithor/social/hn_scanner.py` — HackerNewsScanner: Firebase API for story IDs, Algolia for search, HN-culture-aware LLM scoring, zero auth required
  - `src/cognithor/social/discord_scanner.py` — DiscordScanner: REST API v10 via httpx, bot token auth, message history fetch, 1s rate limiting between channels
  - `src/cognithor/mcp/social_tools.py` — 2 unified MCP tools: `social_scan` (dispatches to any/all platforms), `social_leads` (unified listing with platform filter)
  - Lead model gains `platform`, `platform_id`, `platform_url` fields; store migration with platform-aware queries
  - `RedditLeadService` extended with `scan_hackernews()`, `scan_discord()`, `scan_all()` methods
  - Config: `hn_enabled`, `hn_categories`, `hn_min_score`, `hn_scan_interval_minutes`, `discord_scanner_enabled`, `discord_scan_channels`, `discord_min_score`, `discord_scan_interval_minutes`
  - Gateway wiring: HN/Discord scanners initialized in post-init block
  - Flutter: HN + Discord config sections in Social Listening page
  - Gatekeeper: `social_scan` and `social_leads` classified as GREEN
- **Hierarchical Document Reasoning** — 4th retrieval channel (tree-based, vectorless)
  - `src/cognithor/memory/hierarchical/` — 8 modules: 5 parsers (markdown, pdf, docx, html, plaintext), `tree_builder`, `tree_store` (SQLite), `node_selector` (LLM-navigated), `retrieval`, `manager`
  - Builds heading-based document trees; LLM navigates tree structure to find relevant sections
  - No embeddings required — structural understanding through document hierarchy
  - 136 tests
- **CAG Layer (Cache-Augmented Generation)** — KV-cache prefix reuse for LLM acceleration
  - `src/cognithor/memory/cag/` — 7 modules: `content_normalizer`, `cache_store`, `selectors`, `metrics`, `builders/prefix_builder`, `builders/native_builder`, `manager`

  - Section navigation, validation, model selection from available models
  - Launched via `cognithor --config-tui`
- Pre-release smoke test in publish workflow (wheel build + install + startup verification)
- Version consistency check in CI (pyproject.toml vs __init__.py)
- `scripts/prepare_release.py` for local pre-release validation
- `scripts/verify_readme_claims.py` for README claims verification
- 17 new tests (release smoke, env overrides, security regression)

### Changed
- **Package rename**: `jarvis` → `cognithor` across 1,265 files (5,770 replacements)
  - Both `cognithor` and `jarvis` entry points preserved for backward compatibility
  - All internal imports, config paths, env vars updated
- **AST-Based Security** — Python `ast.NodeVisitor` + `bashlex` shell parser replace regex guards
  - `src/cognithor/security/python_ast_guard.py` (40 tests)
  - `src/cognithor/security/shell_ast_guard.py` (48 tests, bashlex + regex fallback)
- **`_safe_call()` pattern** — 79 silent `except Exception: pass` replaced with tracked error handling
  - `src/cognithor/core/safe_call.py` — `_safe_call()` + `_safe_call_async()` with failure registry

- **Evolution deep learner** — Fixed infinite loop (hardcoded queries → LLM-generated), max rounds limit

### Fixed
- **i18n language selection** (#109) — English language selection now fully applied during installation; previously agents, planner formulate-response prompts, and voice channels defaulted to German even when English was selected. `installer/first_run.py` post-processes `agents.yaml` after wizard; `planner._build_formulate_messages` uses locale-aware `_FORMULATE_TEMPLATES` dict; telegram/whatsapp/signal/voice_ws_bridge accept `stt_language` from config.
- Environment variable overrides: JARVIS_* prefix now supported for backward compatibility
- Multi-word top-level config keys (owner_name, llm_backend_type) now correctly overridden via env vars
- Makefile venv path updated from .jarvis to .cognithor
- README numeric claims verified and corrected
- `await` outside async function in gateway.py (CAG hook in sync function)
- `cag_prefix` MagicMock crash in tests (isinstance check)
- `_BootstrapRequest` missing at runtime (TYPE_CHECKING import)
- Reddit tools `parameters` vs `input_schema` keyword mismatch
- Reddit tools missing JSON Schema `"type": "object"` wrapper
- `ModelsConfig.default` AttributeError (field doesn't exist)
- Reddit LLM scoring missing `model` parameter
- `WindowsPath` concatenation in `encrypted_db.py`
- Evolution goals dict vs string format mismatch
- Multiple CI failures from rename leftovers (python -m jarvis, PREREQUISITES.md, first_boot.py)

## [0.84.0] -- 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Reddit Lead Hunter** — Full social listening system integrated into Cognithor
  - `src/jarvis/social/` package: models, store, scanner, reply, service (5 modules)

  - `LeadsScreen` with stats bar (New/Reviewed/Replied), filter row (SegmentedButton), lead list
  - `LeadCard` widget with score badge, subreddit, status chip, action buttons
  - `LeadDetailSheet` bottom sheet with editable reply editor, Post Reply / Copy / Open on Reddit / Archive
  - `RedditLeadsProvider` with 30s polling, filtering, scan trigger
  - Scan Now FAB with loading spinner
  - 6 API client methods, 21 i18n keys in EN/DE/ZH/AR
- **Social Listening Config Page** — Configuration > System > Social Listening
  - Product name, description, subreddits, min score, scan interval, reply tone, auto-post
  - Orange warning banner when required fields empty

### Fixed
- **3 showstopper bugs** found by deep code audit:
  - MCP tools never registered (Phase D ran before Phase F created the service) — moved to post-init
  - LLM function always None in scanner — wired `self._ollama.chat` post-init
  - Gatekeeper blocked all reddit tools at ORANGE risk — added to GREEN/YELLOW sets
- Default subreddits from SocialConfig now propagated to scan path
- MCP tool `min_score=0` no longer silently overridden to 60
- Flutter social config default min_score aligned to 60 (was 50)

## [0.83.0] -- 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Reddit Lead Hunter Backend** — 7 backend modules (Plan A):
  - Data models (Lead, LeadStatus, ScanResult, LeadStats)

- **AgentBudgetStatus** model — Per-agent daily cost, limit, ok/warning status.
- **Cooperative Scheduling** — `EvolutionLoop` checks `ResourceMonitor` before each step (scout/research/build). Pauses when system busy (CPU/RAM/GPU over thresholds). Respects per-agent budget limits from `EvolutionConfig.agent_budgets`.
- **REST API** — `GET /api/v1/budget/agents` (per-agent costs today/week/month + budget status), `GET /api/v1/system/resources` (live CPU/RAM/GPU snapshot).

- **EvolutionResumer** (`src/jarvis/evolution/resume.py`) — Loads last checkpoint, determines resume point (`ResumeState`), lists/clears cycles. Supports resume after any interrupted step (scout/research/build/reflect).
- **Step-Level Checkpointing** — `EvolutionLoop` saves checkpoint after each completed step via `CheckpointStore`. Stores as `PersistentCheckpoint` under `evolution-{cycle_id}` session.
- **REST API** — `GET /api/v1/evolution/stats` enriched with checkpoint + resume state, `POST /api/v1/evolution/resume` triggers manual resume of interrupted cycles.
- **Flutter Evolution Dashboard** — New config page with 4-step stepper (Scout→Research→Build→Reflect), resume button for interrupted cycles, resource status bars, recent activity table. Auto-refresh every 15s.

- **Gateway integration** — Quick-scan on startup, cached stable results, fresh volatile scans.
- **REST API** — `GET /api/v1/system/profile` returns full hardware profile, `POST /api/v1/system/rescan` forces full re-scan.
- **Flutter Hardware Page** — New config page under System > Hardware showing tier badge, recommended mode, all detection results with color-coded status badges and expandable raw data.
- **22 tests** for SystemDetector and SystemProfile.

#### Frontier Agent
- **Cloud-powered escalation agent** — Priority 8 (highest), triggered by keywords "komplex", "architektur", "refactoring", "advanced", "expert". Uses Cloud model (Claude/GPT) for tasks exceeding local model capabilities. 5-minute timeout, 2GB RAM limit, delegates to jarvis/researcher/coder.

#### Chat Branching Wire-up
- **ConversationTree nodes stored** — Every user message + assistant response saved as tree nodes in SQLite.
- **Tree sidebar data loading** — TreeProvider loads via `GET /api/v1/chat/tree/latest` REST endpoint after each message.
- **Resizable tree sidebar** — Drag right edge (180-450px), tooltips on hover, click to navigate, fork point badges.

### Changed
- **i18n** — Transliterated German umlauts in 1568 docstring lines + all comment lines across 210+ files. Code comments/docstrings now English, user-facing strings remain German.
- **11,649+ tests** (was 11,627).
- **0.0.0.0 API binding** — Default API host changed from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 for mobile/network access.
- **Tailscale + AltServer** — Auto-start/stop alongside Cognithor in start_cognithor.bat.

### Fixed
- Test assertion "Einzelanfrage" → "Single request" (translated production code).
- Test assertion "gekuerzt"/"truncated" synced with production output.
- Test assertion "Pfad" → "Path" (translated gatekeeper message).
- Test vault_delete moved YELLOW→ORANGE in test fixture.
- Stray `_status_cb` reference removed from gateway tree_update block.

## [0.58.0] -- 2026-03-27

### Added

#### Smart Recovery & Transparency System
- **Pre-Flight Plan Preview** — Before complex plans (2+ steps), Cognithor shows a compact plan card with 3-second auto-execute countdown. User can cancel but doesn't have to. Agentic-first: never blocks.
- **Live Correction Detection** — User types "Nein", "Stopp", "Stattdessen X" during execution → system cancels current plan, injects correction context, replans. No edit/rewind needed.
- **Post-Correction Learning** — `CorrectionMemory` (SQLite) stores user corrections. After 3 similar corrections, Cognithor proactively asks before acting. Reminders injected into Planner context via ContextPipeline.
- **RecoveryConfig** — Configurable: pre_flight_enabled, timeout (3s), min_steps (2), correction_learning, proactive_threshold (3).

#### Chat Branching — Full Conversation Tree
- **ConversationTree** — Every message is a node with parentId/childIds. SQLite persistence, fork detection, path computation, replay support. 11 tests.
- **Branch-Aware Gateway** — `switch_branch()` replays message history into fresh WorkingMemory. Session-lock protected.
- **WebSocket branch_switch** — Real-time branch switching from Flutter UI.
- **REST API** — `GET /api/v1/chat/tree/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/chat/path/{id}/{leaf}`, `POST /api/v1/chat/branch`.
- **TreeProvider** (Flutter) — Active path tracking, fork point detection, branch navigation.
- **BranchNavigator** — Inline `< 1/3 >` controls at fork points.
- **TreeSidebar** — Optional collapsible tree overview panel (toggle via toolbar).

#### Chat UX Improvements
- **Claude-style Edit** — Edit rewrites conversation from that point. Old + new versions preserved.
- **Version Navigator** — `< 1/2 >` arrows to switch between edit versions.
- **Copy Message** — Copy icon on all messages (user + assistant).
- **Retry** — Refresh icon on last assistant message to regenerate.
- **Edit + Copy + Retry icons** — Visible on every message bubble.

### Fixed

#### Security Audit (8 Fixes)
- **Browser tools classified** — `browse_click`, `browse_fill`, `browse_execute_js` now ORANGE in Gatekeeper (were unclassified → accidental ORANGE).
- **SQL injection fixed** — `persistence.py` ORDER BY clause now uses strict allowlist instead of f-string interpolation.
- **HMAC/Ed25519 in record_event()** — `AuditTrail.record_event()` now signs entries like `record()` does. Previously unsigned entries created gaps in the cryptographic chain.
- **Key file permissions** — HMAC and Ed25519 key files now `chmod 0o600` after generation.
- **Path traversal regex** — `shell.py` regex now catches single `../` (was `{2,}`, now `{1,}`).
- **vault_delete → ORANGE** — Destructive operation moved from YELLOW (inform) to ORANGE (approve).
- **TSA fallback URLs → HTTPS** — DigiCert and Apple timestamp servers now use HTTPS.
- **BreachDetector thread-safe** — `_entries` access wrapped in `list()` copy.

#### Gateway Audit (10 Fixes)
- **shutdown() cancels background tasks** — Infinite loops (retention, breach, curiosity) now properly cancelled before resource cleanup.
- **switch_branch() session-locked** — `_working_memories` write protected by `_session_lock`.
- **OpenAI empty choices guard** — `data.get("choices") or [{}]` prevents IndexError on content-filtered responses.
- **Pre-flight timeout capped** — Hard upper bound of 30 seconds prevents indefinite blocking.
- **_pattern_record_timestamps → instance var** — Was ClassVar shared across instances, now per-instance.
- **Delegation session_id** — `execute_delegation()` now passes `session_id` to `set_agent_context()`.
- **Presearch LLM guard** — `_answer_from_presearch()` returns early if `self._llm` is None.
- **_keepalive_task tracked** — Added to `_background_tasks` set for proper cleanup.
- **database_tools fetchone() guard** — All 8 `fetchone()[0]` patterns now check for None.
- **Silent except → log.debug** — Pattern search `except Exception: pass` now logs.

#### Config + Flutter Audit (8 Fixes)
- **`/api/v1/health` unauthenticated** — Removed auth dependency (was breaking bootstrap flow).
- **factory-reset endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/config/factory-reset` now exists.
- **Flutter browser defaults** — Fixed field names (was headless/timeout/max_pages → correct BrowserConfig fields).
- **Flutter email defaults** — `password` → `password_env`, `smtp_port` 587 → 465.
- **LMStudio defaults** — `lmstudio_api_key` and `lmstudio_base_url` added to Flutter.
- **German tooltips → English** — Edit/Copy/Retry tooltips now English (locale-neutral).
- **TreeProvider registered** — Added to `main.dart` MultiProvider (was missing → crash).

### Changed
- **11,627+ tests** (was 11,609).

## [0.57.0] -- 2026-03-26

### Fixed

#### Gatekeeper Tool Classification (Critical)
- **4 Knowledge Synthesis tools** (`knowledge_synthesize`, `knowledge_contradictions`, `knowledge_timeline`, `knowledge_gaps`) were missing from the GREEN tools list. They defaulted to ORANGE, causing the Executor to skip them with `GatekeeperBlock` error — resulting in **0% success rate**. Now classified as GREEN (read-only analysis tools).
- **3 Vault tools** (`vault_read`, `vault_update`, `vault_link`) were missing from the gatekeeper. `vault_read` added to GREEN, `vault_update` and `vault_link` added to YELLOW.

#### Auto-Learned Procedure Naming
- Procedures auto-generated by the Causal Learning system were saved with cryptic names like `pattern-6e8e62b97567.md`. Now uses **human-readable slugs** from the top 3 trigger keywords (e.g., `schreibe-schachbot-starte.md`). Added duplicate detection: if a file with the same name exists, appends a 6-char hash; if that also exists, skips (true duplicate).

#### Config Editability
- **5 config sections** (`browser`, `calendar`, `email`, `identity`, `personality`) were not in `_EDITABLE_SECTIONS` — changes from the Flutter UI were silently rejected. Now editable via the config PATCH API.
- **Flutter save() list** was missing `improvement`, `prompt_evolution`, and the 5 sections above. All now included with proper defaults in `_defaults()`.

#### Code Quality
- **11 E501 lines** (> 100 chars) broken across 6 files: config.py, autonomous_orchestrator.py, llm_backend.py, planner.py, trace_optimizer.py, skill_tools.py.
- **5 unused imports** removed (dead code in token_budget.py, evolution_orchestrator.py, execution_trace.py, reflexion.py).
- **3 planned imports** restored with `# noqa: F401` annotation (shutil in editor.py, CausalFinding in trace_optimizer.py, asyncio in deep_research_v2.py) — referenced in docstrings or needed for upcoming features.
- **Ruff lint status**: 0 errors on F401/F811/F821/E501. Only 33 E402 remain (intentional re-exports in `__init__.py` files).

## [0.56.0] -- 2026-03-26

### Added

#### Skill Marketplace & Community Registry
- **15 builtin skills published** to [skill-registry](https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/skill-registry) on GitHub — productivity (7), research (2), analysis (2), development (2), legal (1), automation (1).
- **`publish_skill` MCP tool** — Publish local skills to the community registry directly from chat. Validates frontmatter, computes SHA-256 hash, uploads to GitHub, updates registry.json. Uses git credential manager for auth.
- **`publish_builtin_skills.py` script** — Batch-publishes all builtin skills with manifest.json generation and registry index update.
- **Full marketplace loop**: create_skill → publish_skill → search_community_skills → install_community_skill (5-stage validation) → use.

#### 5 New Builtin Skills
- **Meeting-Protokoll** (priority 6) — Audio transcription → structured protocol with decisions, action items, deadlines, follow-up emails. Tools: media_transcribe_audio, write_file, email_send, vault_save.
- **Tages-Report** (priority 6) — End-of-day summary from episodes + memory + calendar. Erledigt / Offen / Morgen format. Tools: get_recent_episodes, search_memory, calendar_upcoming.
- **Code Review** (priority 6) — 5-dimension review (correctness, security, performance, maintainability, tests) with line-number references. Routed to coder agent. Tools: git_diff, analyze_code, read_file.
- **Vertrags-Pruefer** (priority 6) — 7-dimension contract analysis (parties, obligations, costs, termination, liability, privacy, red flags) with risk rating and legal disclaimer. Tools: media_extract_text, analyze_document, vault_save.
- **Workflow-Recorder** (priority 7) — "Show me once, then do it forever." User describes a process → Cognithor creates a reusable skill with trigger keywords and tool mappings. Tools: create_skill, list_skills.

#### Thumbs Up/Down Feedback System
- **FeedbackStore** (`core/feedback.py`) — SQLite-backed storage for user ratings with session/message/agent tracking.
- **4 REST endpoints**: POST /feedback, PATCH /feedback/{id}, GET /feedback/stats, GET /feedback/recent.
- **WebSocket integration** — `feedback` and `feedback_comment` message types for real-time rating from chat.
- **Follow-up on negative feedback** — On thumbs down, system asks "Was hat nicht gepasst?" via `feedback_followup` message. User's comment is stored for self-improvement.
- **Flutter FeedbackButtons widget** — Thumbs up/down icons below every assistant message, with confirmation state and inline follow-up banner.

#### Interactive DAG Visualization
- **InteractiveDagGraph widget** — Pan/zoom (pinch gesture + drag) and node tap detection (30px hit radius) for the workflow DAG view.
- **DagNodeDetail panel** — Shows node status, duration, retries, type, tool name, output (truncated), and errors when a node is tapped.
- **Node selection highlight** — Selected node gets glowing border in the graph.
- **Node detail API** — `GET /api/v1/workflows/dag/runs/{run_id}/nodes/{node_id}` returns single node execution data.

### Changed
- **123 MCP tools** (was 112). New: publish_skill + 6 background task tools + feedback tools.
- **15 builtin skills** (was 10). New: meeting-protokoll, tages-report, code-review, vertrag-pruefer, workflow-recorder.
- **11,609+ tests** (was 11,595).

### Fixed
- CI lint: F821 `config_manager` scope in audit endpoints — extracted to local variable.
- CI lint: ruff format on 19 files (feedback.py, gateway.py, skill_tools.py, etc.).
- Gatekeeper test: `screenshot_desktop` and `computer_screenshot` need `ToolsConfig(enabled=True)` in test fixtures since desktop tools are OFF by default.
- GitHub Pages landing page: updated from v0.47.1 to v0.55.0 (now v0.56.0), test count badge fixed.

## [0.55.0] -- 2026-03-26

### Added

#### Audit & Compliance (EU AI Act + GDPR)
- **HMAC-SHA256 Audit Signatures** — Every audit trail entry is cryptographically signed. Auto-generates 256-bit key at `~/.jarvis/audit_key` on first use.
- **Ed25519 Asymmetric Signatures** — Optional upgrade: private key signs, public key verifies. Key pair auto-generated at `~/.jarvis/audit_ed25519.key` + `.pub`. Requires `cryptography` package.
- **Blockchain Audit Anchoring** — `AuditTrail.get_anchor()` returns chain head hash + entry count for external blockchain/Arweave anchoring.

- **Audit Hash-Chain Verification** — `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` reads `gatekeeper.jsonl` and validates the full SHA-256 hash chain.
- **Audit Timestamps API** — `GET /api/v1/audit/timestamps` lists all RFC 3161 `.tsr` files.
- **Daily Audit Retention Cleanup** — Background task removes entries older than `audit.retention_days` (default 90) and background job logs older than 7 days.
- **Flutter Audit Page** — New config page under Security > Audit with chain verification button, TSA timestamp list, and GDPR data export.

#### Background Process Manager
- **6 new MCP tools**: `start_background`, `list_background_jobs`, `check_background_job`, `read_background_log`, `stop_background_job`, `wait_background_job`.
- **ProcessMonitor** with 5 verification methods: process-alive, exit-code, output-stall detection, timeout enforcement, resource check (optional psutil).
- **SQLite persistence** (`~/.jarvis/background_jobs.db`) — survives restarts, orphan detection on boot.
- **Log management** — Per-job log files at `~/.jarvis/workspace/background_logs/`, tail/head/grep support, 10MB limit, auto-cleanup.
- **Status notifications** — Channel-aware callbacks when background jobs complete/fail/timeout.

#### Multi-Agent System
- **5 Specialized Agents** — jarvis (generalist), researcher (web research), coder (programming), office (email/calendar), operator (DevOps). Each with custom system prompt, trigger keywords/patterns, and tool restrictions.
- **Agent Model Overrides** — `preferred_model`, `temperature`, `top_p` per agent, wired through gateway to planner. Coder uses `qwen3-coder:30b`, Office/Operator use `qwen3:8b`.
- **Agent Delegation Chain** — jarvis delegates to all 4 specialists; each can delegate back. Delegation path also respects agent LLM overrides.
- **`top_p` field** added to AgentProfile and agent CRUD API.

- **Runtime reload** — Toggle changes take effect immediately via `reload_disabled_tools()`.

#### MCP Server for VSCode
- **`--mcp-server` CLI flag** — Starts Jarvis as pure stdio MCP server for VSCode/Claude Desktop/Cursor. Only workspace-safe tools exposed (37 tools, no shell/desktop/docker).
- **`MCP_WORKSPACE_SAFE_TOOLS`** allowlist in `bridge.py`.
- **`mode_override`** parameter on `MCPBridge.setup()` to force stdio mode.

### Changed
- **Planner prompt** — Capability questions ("was kannst du?") answered as text from tool list, no web search. Agents answer from tool knowledge, not via `list_skills` tool plan.
- **11,595+ tests** (was 11,509).

### Fixed
- **start_cognithor.bat** — CRLF line endings (was LF, caused cmd.exe parse errors on Windows).
- **Flutter Ctrl+S** — Prevented browser Save-As dialog; now triggers Flutter config save.
- **Flutter config_provider.dart** — `tools` section added to save() list and defaults (toggle was reverting).
- **config_manager.py** — `tools` and `audit` added to `_EDITABLE_SECTIONS`.
- **Icons** — `Icons.mouse` replaced with `Icons.desktop_windows` (mouse was tree-shaken).

- **Backend**: `POST /api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with CodeContext support.
- **VSIX**: Built and installable (`cognithor-vscode-0.1.0.vsix`, 26KB).

## [0.53.0] -- 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Truly Autonomous Coding**: 50 iterations (was 20), failure threshold 70% (was 50%). Cognithor writes code, tests it, debugs errors, rewrites, and re-tests autonomously until it works.
- **Autonomous Task Orchestrator**: Complex/recurring tasks auto-decomposed with self-evaluation and quality scoring.
- **Deep Research by Default**: Complex queries auto-escalate to `deep_research` with multi-source consensus.
- **Periodic Thinking Status**: UI shows "Denke nach... (15s)" during long planning phases.
- **Auto-Extract Code**: When planner returns code in permission text, auto-creates `write_file` plan.

### Changed
- **Ollama/Qwen3:32b as default planner** — local-first, no API key needed, no permission issues.
- **`operation_mode: offline` now respected** — API keys no longer override backend when offline mode set.
- **Planner prefix in English** — more authoritative for Claude, explicitly blocks permission keywords.
- **REPLAN "Fehler fixen?"** — first option when code fails, before "Fertig?".
- **No external software rule** — planner must use only Python libraries, never Stockfish/ffmpeg/ImageMagick.
- **GREEN for core tools** — `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_python`, `exec_command` no longer require approval.
- **Auto-approve all ORANGE tools** — for fully autonomous operation.
- **Claude Code timeout 600s** (was 120s, was overridden by Ollama config).

### Fixed
- WebSocket reconnection storm (don't close stale connections).
- WebSocket accept before close (Windows semaphore error).
- CancelledError in keepalive task (BaseException, not Exception).
- Splash screen race condition (StatefulWidget with guard).
- Approval handler signature mismatch (`action` vs `tool` param).

## [0.52.0] -- 2026-03-21

### Added
- **SSH Remote Shell Backend**: Execute commands on remote hosts via SSH. 3 MCP tools (`remote_exec`, `remote_list_hosts`, `remote_test_connection`). Host registration, command validation, dangerous-pattern blocking. `remote_exec` requires ORANGE gatekeeper approval.
- **GEPA Robustness Overhaul**: Longer evaluation windows (MIN_TRACES 10→20, MIN_SESSIONS_FOR_EVAL 5→15), user approval for high-impact proposals (prompt_patch, guardrail, strategy_change), LLM-powered patch generation (was stub), cascade failure auto-detection. New `GET /api/v1/learning/gepa/status` endpoint.
- **Docker Real-Life Test Suite**: 15 scenario tests across 7 categories (web research, file ops, remote exec, memory, tool coverage, GEPA safety, session management). Dockerfile + docker-compose for isolated testing.
- **Research Auto-Escalation**: REPLAN_PROMPT now includes quality self-assessment — checks source count, agreement, gaps. Auto-escalates to `deep_research`/`search_and_read` when results are thin. SYSTEM_PROMPT adds "Gruendlichkeit" principle.
- **Flutter UI: Incognito Badge**: Purple badge in AppBar when active session is incognito. "Inkognito Chat" button in session drawer.
- **Flutter UI: Search Bar**: Live full-text search across all chats in session drawer.
- **Flutter UI: Project Sidebar**: Sessions grouped by folder with ExpansionTile. Incognito sessions show purple icon.

### Fixed
- **Mobile bottom nav**: Reduced from 8 items to 5 on phones. Removed Search/Light/Office action buttons from mobile bottom bar (remain on tablet/desktop).
- **Splash screen session reuse**: App no longer creates a new session on every launch. Uses `autoSessionOnStartup()` to resume recent sessions or create new after 30 min inactivity.
- **Light mode**: `textPrimary`, `textSecondary`, `textTertiary` and `codeBlockBg` are now theme-aware. White text on white background and dark code blocks on light background fixed.

### Testing
- Full suite: 11,475 tests passing (was 11,447)
- 15 new real-life scenario tests
- 11 new tests (remote shell, GEPA robustness, research quality)
- 0 regressions

## [0.51.0] -- 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Auto-New-Session**: Automatically creates a fresh chat session after 30 minutes of inactivity instead of resuming stale conversations. Configurable via `config.session.inactivity_timeout_minutes`.
- **Project Folders**: Group chat sessions into projects/folders. Sidebar groups sessions by folder with filtered API listing (`GET /api/v1/sessions/by-folder/{folder}`).
- **Incognito Mode**: Sessions that skip memory enrichment (context pipeline) and don't persist chat history. No long-term memory reads or writes. `POST /api/v1/sessions/new-incognito`.
- **Session Export**: Download any chat session as JSON with full metadata (`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/export`).
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across all chat messages in all sessions (`GET /api/v1/sessions/search?q=...`). Flutter search bar wired.
- **GDPR Retention Enforcement**: `cleanup_old_sessions()` and `cleanup_channel_mappings()` now run periodically via gateway cron (30-day retention for inactive sessions).
- **SessionConfig**: New config section with `inactivity_timeout_minutes` (default 30) and `chat_history_limit` (default 100).
- 19 new tests in `tests/test_session_management/` covering all features.

### Fixed
- **Chat history leak**: System messages (identity axioms, trust boundary, context pipeline output) and raw tool results (web search HTML) were displayed as chat bubbles when switching sessions. Now only `user` and `assistant` messages are persisted and returned.
- **Claude Code permission loop**: Planner asked "Ich brauche Freigabe für WebSearch" instead of generating JSON tool plans. Fixed with `_PLANNER_PREFIX` framing and SYSTEM_PROMPT restructuring.
- **Chat history limit**: Increased from hardcoded 20 to configurable 100 messages on session resume.

### Changed
- `save_chat_history()` now filters to `_VISIBLE_ROLES = {"user", "assistant"}` — system/tool messages excluded.
- `get_session_history()` SQL includes `AND role IN ('user', 'assistant')` for legacy data compat.
- `ClaudeCodeBackend._messages_to_prompt()` prepends planner-framing prefix.

### Testing

- Prompt presets synced: English + Chinese translations match new style
- formulate_response() prompts condensed (7 REGELN → 1 sentence)
- Personality directives shorter and more natural
- Greetings: "Morgen!" / "" / "Hey, guten Abend!" / "Na, auch noch wach?"
- Sentiment messages: removed "HINWEIS:" prefix, shorter

### Fixed
- trace_optimizer: `get()` → `get_trace()`, `get_recent()` → `get_recent_traces()`
- Personality test assertions updated to match new wording
- Chat bubble light mode contrast (dark text on light background)
- Hashline read_file pre-caches only, doesn't change output format

### Testing
- 97 E2E scenario tests (all passing)
- 8 automated test methods: mypy, bandit, API contract, SQLite schemas, Hypothesis, stress test, dependency audit, config fuzzing

- **Flutter app README**: Replaced placeholder with proper documentation covering architecture, project structure, development workflow, and key files

### Changed
- All user-facing documentation now in English
- `FIRST_BOOT.md`: Updated "Jarvis" references to "Cognithor" throughout
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Added v0.47.0 and v0.47.1 entries

## [0.47.0] -- 2026-03-19

### Added

- Test suite: 10,800+ tests

## [0.33.0-beta] – 2026-03-11

### Added
- **i18n Language Pack System**: JSON-based internationalization with dot-notation keys (`t("error.timeout")`), SHA-256 integrity verification, thread-safe locale switching, fallback chain (locale → EN → raw key). Ships with German and English packs (~250 keys each). New module: `src/jarvis/i18n/`
- **Language Switcher in UI**: Control Center header quick-toggle button (DE/EN) + General page dropdown. Language changes are live via `reload_components(config=True)` — no restart needed
- **Locales API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/locales` returns available language packs and active locale
- **English locale tests**: New test class `TestEnglishLocale` validates error messages in both locales

### Fixed
- **Planner JSON Parse Retry** (critical): When the LLM returns malformed JSON, the planner now detects the failure (via `parse_failed` flag on `ActionPlan`), automatically retries with a format hint and lower temperature, and provides a clear error message to the user if both attempts fail. Previously, malformed JSON was silently converted to a direct response ("task failed successfully")
- **LLM Timeout Wiring**: `embed()` and `embed_batch()` in `model_router.py` now use `self._timeout` from config instead of hardcoded 30s/60s. LLM timeout field added to Executor page in UI (visible for all backends, not just Ollama)
- **WebSocket Race Condition** (critical): New `_ws_safe_send()` helper wraps all 12 `websocket.send_json()` calls in `__main__.py`. Returns `False` on disconnection errors, breaking the message loop cleanly instead of crashing with "Cannot call 'send'"
- **GlobalSearch "Einstellung suchen"** (broken since v29): Added 3 missing pages to `FIELD_INDEX` and `PAGE_LABELS` in `GlobalSearch.jsx`: Executor, Workflows, Knowledge Graph. Search now finds all 19 config pages
- **Pre-existing `_validate_url` async bug**: Fixed 14 test methods in `test_web.py` and `test_web_coverage.py` that called `async _validate_url()` without `await`
- **German umlaut encoding in de.json**: Replaced ASCII-safe substitutions (ue/oe/ae) with proper UTF-8 characters (ü/ö/ä) across ~80 occurrences

### Changed
- `ActionPlan` model: New `parse_failed: bool` field (default `False`)
- `config_manager.py`: Added `language` to `_EDITABLE_TOP_LEVEL` set
- `gateway.py`: `reload_components(config=True)` now calls `set_locale()` for live language switching
- `conftest.py`: Global `set_locale("de")` autouse fixture for test backwards compatibility
- Test count: 10,165 → **10,208** (43 new tests)

## [0.30.0] – 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Dokument-Lese-Tools**: 3 neue MCP-Tools (`read_pdf`, `read_ppt`, `read_docx`) fuer strukturiertes Lesen von PDF, PowerPoint und Word-Dokumenten mit Formatierung, Tabellen, Bilderextraktion und Metadaten
- **mTLS fuer WebUI-API**: Mutual TLS mit automatischer CA/Server/Client-Zertifikatsgenerierung; Malware kann sich nicht mehr als Frontend ausgeben (`security.mtls.enabled`)
- **DB Retry-Logik**: SQLite-Backend wiederholt bei "database is locked" automatisch mit exponentiellem Backoff und Jitter (konfigurierbar via `database.sqlite_max_retries`)
- **PPTX-Textextraktion**: `media_extract_text` unterstuetzt jetzt auch `.pptx`-Dateien

### Changed
- MCP-Tool-Anzahl: 48 → **51** (3 neue Dokument-Lese-Tools)
- Dependencies: `pymupdf>=1.23` und `python-pptx>=0.6` in `[documents]` Extras

## [0.29.1] – 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **CI sandbox test on Windows**: Assertion now accepts `container`/`timeout` keywords in stderr (not just `docker`), fixing false failure on GitHub Actions Windows runners without Docker
- **Encryption dependency**: Changed `sqlcipher3-binary` (non-existent on PyPI) to `pysqlcipher3==1.2.0` — the only cross-platform SQLCipher binding that works on Linux and Windows
- **Encryption import**: Updated `open_sqlite()` to import from `pysqlcipher3.dbapi2` instead of `sqlcipher3`
- **Install safety**: Removed `encryption` from `[all]` extras to prevent install failures for users without native SQLCipher build dependencies; encryption remains available via `pip install cognithor[encryption]` or `cognithor[full]`

## [0.29.0] – 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **UI layout wiggle**: Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to prevent horizontal content shift when scrollbar appears/disappears on page navigation
- **Unsaved changes false positives**: Snapshot now captured directly from fetched API data in `loadAllConfig()`, eliminating React batching race condition; removed redundant SPA navigation guard (page switch preserves state)
- **Keyboard shortcuts inconsistent**: Sequential `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+0` mapping for first 10 pages; Executor now accessible via `Cmd+6`; key lookup by field instead of array index
- **token_estimate always 0**: `WorkingMemory.add_message()` now updates `token_count` with word-based token estimation (compound-aware); `clear_for_compaction()` recalculates after pruning
- **SkillTester subprocess fails**: Safe environment now includes `PYTHONPATH`, `APPDATA`, and `VIRTUAL_ENV` so pytest subprocess can find installed packages

### Added
- **SQLite encryption (optional)**: SQLCipher support with OS keyring key storage (`pip install cognithor[encryption]`); new `database.encryption_enabled` toggle in UI; `src/jarvis/db/encryption.py` module with `open_sqlite()`, `init_encryption()`, `get_encryption_key()`, `remove_encryption_key()`

### Removed
- **Speed field from Models UI**: Was a metadata-only field with no runtime effect; removed to avoid user confusion

## [0.28.0] – 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Vite dev server unreachable**: Explicit `host: '127.0.0.1'` binding prevents IPv6/IPv4 mismatch on newer Node.js versions where `localhost` resolves to `::1`
- **Deprecated `locale.getdefaultlocale()`**: Replaced with `getlocale()` in bootstrap to fix Python 3.13+ deprecation warning (removal in 3.15)

### Changed
- **Coder model updated**: `qwen3-coder:32b` (non-existent) → `qwen3-coder:30b` (official Qwen3-Coder MoE, 18 GB) across all configs, docs, and bootstrap tiers

## [0.27.5] "BugHunt" – 2026-03-08

### CodeQL Security Sweep & CI Stability

Systematic elimination of all GitHub CodeQL security alerts (60+), cross-platform CI stability fixes, and thread-safety hardening. Test suite expanded to 10,165 tests.

### Fixed

- **CWE-209 Information Exposure** — 60+ instances of `str(exc)` in API responses replaced with generic error messages + server-side logging across `config_routes.py`, `teams.py`, `__main__.py`
- **CWE-22 Path Traversal** — All user-supplied paths validated with `os.path.normpath()` + `startswith()` (CodeQL-recognized pattern) in `__main__.py` (voice models, downloads) and `sanitizer.py`
- **CWE-1333 ReDoS** — Simplified SemVer regex pre-release part in `validator.py` to eliminate exponential backtracking
- **CWE-312 Cleartext Storage** — Renamed `known_secret` to `known_key_data` in test to avoid false positive
- **Workflow Permissions** — Added `permissions: contents: read` to `ci.yml` and `publish.yml` for least-privilege CI
- **Windows CI** — Removed `| head -60` pipe (unavailable in PowerShell), fixed `\a` path escape in `test_production_readiness.py`
- **aiohttp Mock Leakage** — Scoped aiohttp mocks in `test_teams.py` with `patch.dict` to prevent polluting `test_telegram_webhook.py`
- **nio Mock Consistency** — `test_matrix.py` now uses `MagicMock(return_value=...)` so shared mock client has `add_event_callback`
- **Checkpoint Ordering** — Added monotonic `_seq` counter to `Checkpoint` as tiebreaker for same-timestamp sorting
- **EpisodicStore Thread Safety** — All SQLite read methods now serialized with `_write_lock` to prevent corruption under concurrent multi-thread access
- **URL Exact Match** — Groq/DeepSeek URL checks in tests changed from `startswith()` to exact `==` match to satisfy CodeQL

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.27.5 "BugHunt"
- GitHub Stars badge added to README and docs (dynamic, shields.io)
- Test count updated: 10,165 tests, ~118,000 LOC source, ~108,000 LOC tests

## [0.27.3-beta] – 2026-03-07

### Security Fix & Installer Bug-Fixes

Closes a high-severity Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the TTS/Voice API and fixes three installer bugs reported by QA.

### Fixed

- **CWE-22 Path Traversal in TTS API** — Malicious `voice` parameter in `POST /api/v1/tts` could escape the voices directory via `../../../../etc/passwd`. Added `validate_voice_name()` whitelist (regex + null-byte + length check) and `validate_model_path_containment()` defense-in-depth across all 4 TTS entry points (`__main__.py`, `mcp/media.py`, `voice_ws_bridge.py`)
- **Multi-GPU detection crash** (install.sh) — `nvidia-smi` on multi-GPU systems (e.g. 2x Tesla M40) returned multi-line output causing `bash: [[: 12288\n0: syntax error`. Now parses all lines individually and sums VRAM across GPUs
- **`--init-only` hangs indefinitely** — `StartupChecker.check_and_fix_all()` ran before the `--init-only` exit, attempting model pulls (30min timeout) and pip installs (5min timeout). Moved `--init-only` exit before StartupChecker. Added `timeout 30` safety net in install.sh

### Added

- `validate_voice_name()` in `security/sanitizer.py` — Central voice/model name validation against path traversal
- `validate_model_path_containment()` — Defense-in-depth path containment check (resolve + relative_to)
- AMD GPU detection via `rocm-smi` in install.sh
- Node.js missing: distro-specific installation instructions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- 96 new security tests in `test_voice_path_traversal.py`

## [0.27.1] – 2026-03-07

### Community Skill Marketplace & Autonomy Hardening

Introduces the Community Skill Marketplace with full trust chain, plus 13 autonomy fixes across the PGE loop.

### Added

- **Community Skill Marketplace** — Install, search, rate, and report community skills from a GitHub-hosted registry. Publisher verification with trust levels (unknown/community/verified/official). 5-check validation pipeline (syntax, injection, tools, safety, hash)
- **ToolEnforcer** — Runtime tool-allowlist enforcement for community skills. Skills can only invoke tools declared in `tools_required`
- **SkillValidator** — 5-stage validation: syntax check, prompt-injection scan, tool whitelist, safety audit, SHA-256 hash verification
- **CommunityRegistryClient** — Async client for fetching, verifying, and installing skills from remote registries with aiohttp + urllib fallback
- **RegistrySync** — Periodic background sync with recall checks for deactivated/recalled skills
- **PublisherVerifier** — Publisher identity verification with 4 trust levels and GPG signature support
- **Community REST API** — 5 endpoints: search, detail, install, report, publisher info (`/api/v1/skills/community/`)
- **3 New MCP Tools** — `install_community_skill`, `search_community_skills`, `report_skill` (total: 5 in skill_tools.py)
- **Thread-safe Caches** — `asyncio.Lock` protection on all community module caches (client, sync, publisher)
- **aiohttp Fallback** — All HTTP clients gracefully fall back to `urllib` if aiohttp raises RuntimeError

### Fixed

- **Presearch Skip Patterns** — Removed trailing `\b` so "Erstelle/erstellst/erstellen" are recognized as action verbs (no longer misrouted to web search)
- **subprocess Differentiation** — `subprocess.run()` and `subprocess.check_output()` now ALLOWED in run_python; `subprocess.Popen/call/getoutput/getstatusoutput` remain BLOCKED
- **Socket Pattern Narrowing** — Changed from blanket `socket.` block to specific `socket.socket()` and `socket.create_connection()`
- **Project Dir in allowed_paths** — `allow_project_dir: true` (default) auto-adds project root so Cognithor can write to its own codebase
- **Multi-step Plan Early Exit** — PGE loop no longer breaks on first success for multi-step plans; coding tools always continue iteration
- **Failure Threshold** — Smart exit at `max(5, max_iterations // 2)` consecutive failures instead of immediate abort
- **Presearch Truncation** — Increased from 4000 to 8000 chars for better fact-question coverage
- **Planner Circuit Breaker** — Tuned: `failure_threshold=3->5`, `recovery_timeout=30->15s`, `half_open_max_calls=1->2`
- **Replan Retry** — 2 attempts with 1s pause before giving up on replan LLM calls
- **formulate_response Fallback** — On LLM failure, returns raw tool results instead of empty error
- **JSON Confidence** — Lowered from 0.8 to 0.5 for direct answers without JSON parsing
- **try-finally Cleanup** — Skill state (ToolEnforcer, active_skill) cleaned up via single `_cleanup_skill_state()` in finally block
- **Evidence Field Wiring** — Community skill reports now properly pass evidence to persistence layer
- **API Error Handling** — All community endpoints wrapped in try-except with proper HTTPException and logging

### Changed

- `response_token_budget`: 3000 -> 4000
- `memory_top_k`: 4 -> 8
- `vault_top_k`: 3 -> 5
- `max_context_chars`: 3000 -> 8000
- `compaction_keep_last_n`: 4 -> 8
- `budget_injected_memories`: 1500 -> 2500
- Context pipeline failures now log as WARNING (was DEBUG)
- Presearch failures now log as WARNING (was DEBUG)
- Community skill exports: 13 public classes from `skills.community` package

- **Ollama Auto-Install (Linux)** — `install.sh` offers `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
- **Distro-specific Python Hints (Linux)** — Ubuntu deadsnakes PPA, Fedora dnf, Arch pacman, openSUSE zypper, Debian pyenv
- **Locale-based Language Detection** — Auto-sets `language: "de"` or `"en"` in config.yaml based on system locale
- **Hardware Tier Display** — Shows VRAM, RAM, tier (minimal/standard/power/enterprise), and model recommendations before pull
- **LLM Smoke Test** — Post-install HTTP test to verify LLM responds ("Sage kurz Hallo.")
- **Linux .desktop Files** — `cognithor.desktop` (CLI) and `cognithor-webui.desktop` in `~/.local/share/applications/`
- **Pre-built UI Support** — Node.js no longer required if `ui/dist/` exists; FastAPI `StaticFiles` mount at "/"
- **GitHub Beta Release Workflow** — `.github/workflows/beta-release.yml` with lint, test, changelog generation, GitHub pre-release

### Fixed

- **XSS in MessageList.jsx** — Added `escapeHtml()` before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (CRITICAL)
- **CORS + Credentials** — `allow_credentials` now only `true` when origins are explicitly restricted (was always true with `*`)
- **Python Version Check Bug** — `deploy/install-server.sh` checked `(3, 11)` instead of `(3, 12)`
- **Unicode Crash (Windows)** — `first_boot.py` replaced Unicode symbols with ASCII-safe `[OK]`/`[FEHLER]`/`[WARNUNG]`

---

## [0.26.7] – 2026-03-07

### Wiring & Hardening

Closes 7 wiring gaps identified by capability-matrix analysis. Full suite at 9,596 tests (0 failures).

### Added

- **DAG-based Parallel Executor** — `execute()` now builds a `PlanGraph` from actions and runs independent tool calls concurrently in waves via `asyncio.gather()` + `asyncio.Semaphore`. Replaces sequential `for i, ...` loop. Backwards-compatible for linear dependencies
- **http_request Tool** (`mcp/web.py`) — Full HTTP method support (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS) with SSRF protection (`_is_private_ip()`), body-size limit (1 MB), timeout clamping, and domain validation. Classified as ORANGE in Gatekeeper
- **Workflow Adapter** (`core/workflow_adapter.py`) — Bridge function `action_plan_to_workflow()` converts `ActionPlan` to `WorkflowDefinition`, making DAG WorkflowEngine usable from Gateway via `execute_action_plan_as_workflow()`
- **Sub-Agent Depth Guard** — `max_sub_agent_depth` field in `SecurityConfig` (default: 3, range 1–10). `handle_message()` checks depth from `msg.metadata` and rejects if exceeded. `_agent_runner` increments depth per call
- **Live Config Reload** — `reload_config()` methods on Executor and WebTools. PATCH routes in `config_routes.py` call `gateway.reload_components(config=True)` to propagate changes immediately without restart
- **DomainListInput UI Component** — Regex-validated domain input in CognithorControlCenter. Rejects schemes, paths, wildcards, spaces. Used for `domain_blocklist` and `domain_allowlist`
- **Secret Masking Verification** — Explicit tests confirming `google_cse_api_key`, `jina_api_key`, `brave_api_key` are correctly masked by `_is_secret_field()` pattern matching

### Changed

- Blocked actions now count as "completed" in DAG dependency resolution, allowing their dependents to proceed
- `_dag_workflow_engine` attribute declared and initialized in `advanced.py` phase
- Orchestrator runner wired in Gateway (creates `IncomingMessage` with `channel="sub_agent"`)
- DAG WorkflowEngine wired with `_mcp_client` and `_gatekeeper` in Gateway `apply_phase()`
- `SecurityPage` in UI gains `max_sub_agent_depth` NumberInput
- Test count: 9,357 → **9,596** (+239 tests across 9 test files)
- LOC source: ~106,000 → ~109,000
- MCP tool count: 47 → **48** (added http_request)

## [0.26.5] – 2026-03-03

### Added — Human Feel

**Personality & Sentiment**
- **Personality Engine** (`core/personality.py`) — Configurable personality injection into SYSTEM_PROMPT. Time-of-day greetings (Morgen/Nachmittag/Abend/Nacht), warmth/humor scaling, follow-up questions, success celebration. `PersonalityConfig` with `warmth`, `humor`, `greeting_enabled`, `follow_up_questions`, `success_celebration`. 13 tests
- **Sentiment Detection** (`core/sentiment.py`) — Lightweight keyword/regex-based sentiment detection for German text. 5 categories: FRUSTRATED, URGENT, CONFUSED, POSITIVE, NEUTRAL. Confidence scoring, priority-ordered pattern matching. Automatic system-message injection to adapt response style. No ML dependencies. 40 tests
- **User Preference Store** (`core/user_preferences.py`) — SQLite-backed per-user preference persistence. Auto-learned verbosity (terse/normal/verbose) from message length via exponential moving average. Fields: `greeting_name`, `formality`, `verbosity`, `avg_message_length`, `interaction_count`. Verbosity hint injection into working memory. 16 tests
- **User-Friendly Error Messages** (`utils/error_messages.py`) — German error message templates replacing raw exceptions across all channels. `classify_error_for_user(exc)` maps Timeout/Connection/Permission/RateLimit/Memory to empathetic messages. `gatekeeper_block_message()` explains why actions were blocked with suggestions. `retry_exhausted_message()` with tool-specific context. `all_actions_blocked_message()` with per-action reasons. `_friendly_tool_name()` mapping for 22+ tools. 18 tests

**Status Callback System**
- **StatusType Enum** (`channels/base.py`) — 6 status types: THINKING, SEARCHING, EXECUTING, RETRYING, PROCESSING, FINISHING. Default no-op `send_status()` on base Channel class
- **Gateway Status Callbacks** (`gateway/gateway.py`) — Fire-and-forget status callbacks with 2s timeout in PGE loop. Tool-specific status messages via `_TOOL_STATUS_MAP` (22 mappings). "Denke nach..." before planner, tool-specific before executor, "Formuliere Antwort..." before response
- **Executor Retry Visibility** (`core/executor.py`) — "Versuch 2 von 3..." status callbacks during retry loop

### Fixed
- **test_voice VAD fallback** — `test_load_fallback` no longer hardcodes `assert not vad._use_silero`. Now environment-agnostic: accepts both Silero and energy-based fallback. Added separate `test_load_fallback_without_torch` with mocked torch for deterministic fallback testing
- **Executor retry messages** — Now uses `retry_exhausted_message()` instead of raw error strings
- **Channel error handling** — CLI and Telegram now show `classify_error_for_user()` messages instead of raw `f"Fehler: {exc}"`
- **Gateway all-blocked message** — Replaced generic "Alle geplanten Aktionen wurden vom Gatekeeper blockiert" with per-action `all_actions_blocked_message()`

### Changed
- `PersonalityConfig` added to `JarvisConfig` with sensible defaults (warmth=0.7, humor=0.3)
- `Planner.__init__()` accepts optional `personality_engine` parameter
- SYSTEM_PROMPT template gains `{personality_section}` placeholder
- `gateway/phases/pge.py` wires `PersonalityEngine` and `UserPreferenceStore` into initialization

## [0.26.3] – 2026-03-02

### Added — Scaling & Quality

**Scaling (Skalierung)**
- **Distributed Locking** (`core/distributed_lock.py`) — Abstract `DistributedLock` interface with 3 backends: `LocalLockBackend` (asyncio.Lock), `FileLockBackend` (cross-process file locking with msvcrt/fcntl), `RedisLockBackend` (SET NX EX + Lua release).

## [0.26.2] – 2026-03-02

### Added
- **LM Studio Backend** — Full support for LM Studio as a local LLM provider (OpenAI-compatible API on `localhost:1234`). Like Ollama, no API key required, operation mode stays OFFLINE. Includes:
  - `LLMBackendType.LMSTUDIO` enum value and `create_backend()` factory case
  - `lmstudio_api_key` and `lmstudio_base_url` config fields
  - Vision dispatch for OpenAI-compatible image format (`_OPENAI_VISION_BACKENDS` frozenset)
  - Startup banner shows LM Studio URL

- Vision `format_for_backend()` now uses a `_OPENAI_VISION_BACKENDS` frozenset instead of hardcoded `"openai"` check — all OpenAI-compatible backends (including LM Studio) get proper image support

## [0.26.1] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Production Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) — 5-service stack: Jarvis (headless), WebUI (`create_app` factory), Ollama, optional PostgreSQL (pgvector, `--profile postgres`), optional Nginx reverse proxy (`--profile nginx`). GPU support via nvidia-container-toolkit (commented). Health checks on all services
- **Bare-Metal Installer** (`deploy/install-server.sh`) — One-command bootstrap for Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 + Debian 12. Flags: `--domain`, `--email`, `--no-ollama`, `--no-nginx`, `--self-signed`, `--uninstall`. Installs to `/opt/cognithor/`, data in `/var/lib/cognithor/`, creates `cognithor` user, systemd services, Nginx with TLS, ufw firewall
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy** (`deploy/nginx.conf`) — HTTP→HTTPS redirect, TLS 1.2+1.3, WebSocket upgrade for `/ws/`, prefix-strip `/control/` → jarvis:8741, `/health` passthrough, security headers, 55 MB upload, 5 min read timeout
- **Caddy Config** (`deploy/Caddyfile`) — Auto-TLS alternative via Let's Encrypt with same routing as Nginx
- **`.dockerignore`** — Excludes `.git/`, `tests/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, docs, `.env` from Docker builds
- **`create_app()` Factory** (`channels/webui.py`) — ASGI factory for standalone deployment via `uvicorn --factory`. Reads config from env vars (`JARVIS_WEBUI_HOST`, `JARVIS_API_TOKEN`, `JARVIS_WEBUI_CORS_ORIGINS`, TLS). Required by `docker-compose.yml` and systemd service
- **Health Endpoint** (`__main__.py`) — `GET /api/v1/health` on Control Center API (port 8741) returning status, version, and uptime
- **`--api-host` CLI argument** — Bind Control Center API to custom host. Default `127.0.0.1` (unchanged), server mode uses `0.0.0.0`
- **CORS restriction** — When `JARVIS_API_TOKEN` is set, CORS origins are restricted to `JARVIS_API_CORS_ORIGINS` instead of `*`
- **TLS passthrough** — Control Center API passes `ssl_certfile`/`ssl_keyfile` to uvicorn for direct HTTPS

### Fixed
- **`_ssl_cert` UnboundLocalError** — Variables referenced before assignment in `__main__.py` API server block. Moved `_session_store`, `_ssl_cert`, `_ssl_key` definitions before the try block
- **`start_cognithor.bat` crash** — Batch file closed immediately due to: (1) unescaped `|` `)`  `<` in ASCII art echo statements, (2) `::` comments inside `if` blocks (must use `REM`), (3) missing `call` before `npm run dev` (CMD transfers control to `.cmd` without return). All fixed
- **CRLF line endings** — `start_cognithor.bat` had Unix LF line endings; converted to Windows CRLF

### Changed
- `deploy/jarvis.service` — Rewritten for system-level deployment (`/opt/cognithor/venv/bin/jarvis --no-cli --api-host 0.0.0.0`), `User=cognithor`, security hardening, sed instructions for user-level adaptation
- `deploy/jarvis-webui.service` — Rewritten for system-level deployment with `create_app` factory
- `deploy/README.md` — Complete rewrite: Docker Quick Start, Bare-Metal Quick Start, Config Reference, Docker Profiles, TLS (Nginx/Caddy/Direct), Reverse Proxy Endpoints, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, VRAM Profiles
- `.env.example` — Added Server Deployment, WebUI Channel, TLS, and PostgreSQL sections
- `Dockerfile` — Version label updated from `0.1.0` to `0.26.0`

## [0.26.0] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Security Hardening** — Comprehensive runtime security improvements across the entire codebase:
  - **SecureTokenStore** (`security/token_store.py`) — Ephemeral Fernet (AES-256) encryption for all channel tokens in memory. Tokens are never stored as plaintext in RAM. Base64 fallback when `cryptography` is not installed
  - **Runtime Token Encryption** — All 9 channel classes (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, API, WebUI, Matrix, Mattermost) now store tokens encrypted via `SecureTokenStore` with `@property` access for backward compatibility
  - **TLS Support** — Optional SSL/TLS for webhook servers (Teams, WhatsApp) and HTTP servers (API, WebUI). `ssl_certfile`/`ssl_keyfile` config fields in `SecurityConfig`. Minimum TLS 1.2 enforced. Warning logged for non-localhost without TLS

  - **Session Persistence** — Channel-to-session mappings (`_session_chat_map`, `_user_chat_map`, `_session_users`) stored in SQLite via `SessionStore.channel_mappings` table. Survives restarts — Telegram, Discord, Teams, WhatsApp sessions are restored on startup
- **One-Click Launcher** — `start_cognithor.bat` for Windows: double-click → browser opens → click Power On → Jarvis runs. Desktop shortcut included
- 38 new tests for token store, TLS config, session persistence, file-size limits, document size validation

### Fixed
- Matrix channel constructor mismatch in `__main__.py` (`token=` → `access_token=`)
- Teams channel constructor in `__main__.py` now uses correct parameter names (`app_id`, `app_password`)

### Changed
- `SessionStore` gains `channel_mappings` table with idempotent migration, CRUD methods, and cleanup
- `SecurityConfig` gains `ssl_certfile` and `ssl_keyfile` fields
- Version bumped to 0.26.0

## [0.25.0] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Adaptive Context Pipeline** — Automatic pre-Planner context enrichment from Memory (BM25), Vault (full-text search), and Episodes (recent days). Injects relevant knowledge into WorkingMemory before the Planner runs, so Jarvis no longer "forgets" between sessions.
- **ContextPipelineConfig** — New configuration model with `enabled`, `memory_top_k`, `vault_top_k`, `episode_days`, `min_query_length`, `max_context_chars`, `smalltalk_patterns`
