// Package openfeatureprovider is a plugin registry for OpenFeature providers.
// Each provider (flagd, unleash, etc.) lives in its own subpackage, defines its own
// config struct, and self-registers a Constructor via init() - see the unleash
// subpackage for the reference implementation. Binaries opt into a provider with a
// blank import (e.g. cmd/server/main.go), same convention as
// common/asyncworkflow/queue/provider and common/archiver/provider.
