"""The end-and-reenter capture wrapper for guard-pattern task tools.

A guard tool asks for input by *returning* an `InputRequiredResult` rather than
awaiting `ctx.elicit()`. Foreground, each such return is one leg of a
multi-round-trip: the tool returns, the client answers, the framework re-invokes
the tool with the answers on `ctx.input_responses`. The tool body is written
once and is oblivious to how many legs it takes.

As a background task the leg boundary is a *worker* boundary. This wrapper runs
the tool body exactly once. If the body returns a real value, it is the leg's
result. If the body returns an `InputRequiredResult`, the wrapper records the
leg's outstanding requests (and any carried `request_state`) to Redis and
returns — the Docket execution then completes and the worker is freed. The task
sits in `input_required` as durable state until the client answers via
`tasks/update`, which enqueues a fresh Docket execution (the next leg) that
re-runs this wrapper with the accumulated state injected onto `ctx`. No worker
is ever blocked awaiting input.

The wrapper preserves the wrapped callable's signature so Docket's dependency
injection still resolves the tool's parameters (its own args, `ctx`, and any
Docket-native dependencies) exactly as it would for the raw callable. The
per-leg state (`ctx.input_responses` / `ctx.request_state`) is injected by the
worker `Context` factory (`make_task_context`) before the body runs.
