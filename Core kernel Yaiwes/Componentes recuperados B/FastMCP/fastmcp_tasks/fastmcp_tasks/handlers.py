"""SEP-2663 task query/management handlers: tasks/get, tasks/update, tasks/cancel.

Adapted from the SEP-1686 ``requests.py``. The three CRUD-ish handlers survive,
reshaped to the new wire:

- ``tasks/get`` merges the old ``tasks/get`` and ``tasks/result``: the finished
  result is *inlined* into the response for a completed task, a JSON-RPC-shaped
  ``error`` for a failed one, and the outstanding ``inputRequests`` for a task
  waiting on input.
- ``tasks/update`` is new: it delivers ``inputResponses`` to the in-task input
  store, resuming a parked worker.
- ``tasks/cancel`` returns an empty ack (SEP-2663) instead of a task snapshot.
- ``tasks/list`` and ``tasks/result`` are gone (removed by SEP-2663).

The auth-scoped compound key is the authorization boundary: a request resolves a
task only under its own scope's Redis prefix, so a scope mismatch is
indistinguishable from a missing task (both raise -32602 "Task not found"),
which avoids leaking task existence across callers.
