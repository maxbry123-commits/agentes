# Locked-down label helper for the Marvin triage workflow.
#
# Marvin runs on untrusted issue/PR bodies from non-write users, so it must
# NOT be handed raw `gh api` (that would expose every endpoint the app token
# can reach). This helper is the ONLY GitHub write it is allowed to perform:
# it adds or removes repository labels on the one issue/PR being triaged.
#
# The target repo and number come from the environment set by the workflow —
# never from the model — and the operation is fixed to the additive labels
# endpoint (POST/DELETE /repos/{repo}/issues/{n}/labels), which works for both
# issues and PRs and cannot clobber labels applied by other workflows.
