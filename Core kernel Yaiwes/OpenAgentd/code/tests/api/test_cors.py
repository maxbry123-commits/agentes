"""CORS behaviour for cross-origin range-request clients.

Covers the scenario where the web UI is loaded from one origin (e.g. the
Tauri mobile app's local webview) and talks to the API on a different
origin (e.g. a remote LAN server at ``http://192.168.x.x:port``). Browsers
only expose CORS-safelisted response headers to JS for such cross-origin
requests unless the server opts in via ``Access-Control-Expose-Headers`` —
``Accept-Ranges``/``Content-Range`` are not on that safelist, so without
explicit exposure, range-aware clients (pdf.js's progressive-loading probe,
native ``<video>`` byte-range seeking) can't detect partial-content support
and silently fall back to downloading the whole file.
