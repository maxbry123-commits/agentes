"""Tests for the ``ask_user`` HTTP routes.

Covers the full resolution round-trip against a real DB row:

- ``GET  /{sid}/question``                 — cold load / reconnect
- ``POST /{sid}/question/{qid}/answer``    — resolve and resume the turn
- ``POST /{sid}/question/{qid}/dismiss``   — resolve and stop the turn

Answer payloads are the only untrusted input on this path, so the validation
cases (unknown label, free text where it is disallowed, oversized text, stale
question id) are covered as carefully as the happy path.
