"""
Manual scenario tests for the ``ask_user`` durable suspension.
Run with: uv run python tests/manual/question_scenarios.py
Or against a snapshot of a real database (a copy — it writes):
    sqlite3 .openagentd/dev/data/openagentd.db ".backup /tmp/dev.db"
    uv run python tests/manual/question_scenarios.py /tmp/dev.db

The suspension is the feature's whole safety net: the turn survives an app
reload, a daemon restart and a device switch because the pending row *and* the
interrupted tool call live in the database rather than in a coroutine. Every
bug found in this feature so far has lived in a seam between two layers that
were each correct on their own, so these run the real service against a real
database instead of mocking the layer underneath.

The invariant that matters most is C2/B1: the placeholder tool result is what
keeps the conversation well-formed while the turn is parked. Lose it and the
next model call sees an assistant message whose ``tool_calls`` have no matching
``tool`` row, which every strict provider rejects.
