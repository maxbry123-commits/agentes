"""Reserved tool names cannot be supplied as ordinary constructor tools.

``ask_user`` is injected per-run by the agent session,
and that injection is the *only* thing enforcing "coding-mode lead only". A
plugin or MCP server registering a tool under the same name would hand every
member — and every non-coding session — a look-alike, so the constructor
refuses the name outright.
