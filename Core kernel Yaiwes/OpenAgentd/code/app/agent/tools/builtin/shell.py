"""Shell execution tool — streaming output, workdir, platform shell selection.

Design parity with opencode's bash.ts:

- On POSIX, runs via ``$SHELL`` → zsh → bash → sh and rejects incompatible
  shells such as fish/nu. On Windows, uses PowerShell 7 → Windows PowerShell →
  cmd.exe.
- Streaming output: bytes are read incrementally into a bounded head+tail
  buffer; once they exceed ``max_output_bytes`` every byte is streamed to a
  spill file in the XDG session artifact directory, so memory stays bounded
  no matter how much a command prints.  The LLM receives the first and last
  output lines inline, with the spill path advertised so it can ``read`` the
  full output if needed.
- ``workdir`` parameter (optional): run the command in a specific directory.
  Relative paths resolve inside the sandbox workspace. Absolute paths are
  allowed when the caller intentionally needs to run outside the workspace.
- Abort via task cancellation: foreground commands are killed as a process group
  before cancellation propagates.
- Foreground commands default to ``_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``; callers can raise it
  explicitly. On timeout the command is SIGTERMed, given a short grace period to
  clean up, then SIGKILLed.
- Background mode preserved for long-running processes (dev servers etc.).

Output format (foreground)::

    [Succeeded]

    <output>

Or when truncated::

    [Succeeded]

    ...output truncated (full output saved to the XDG session artifact directory)

    <first N/2 lines>
    ...output truncated (K lines omitted)...
    <last N/2 lines>

``[Failed — exit code N]`` prefix when the command exits non-zero.
