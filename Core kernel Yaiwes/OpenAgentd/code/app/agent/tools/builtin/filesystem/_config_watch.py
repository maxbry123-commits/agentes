"""Filesystem-tool post-mutation hook for config caches.

The ``patch`` tool calls :func:`notify_fs_change`
after a successful mutation.  The hook decides whether the path falls
under one of the config trees that have process-level caches, and
invalidates the right cache.

This matters for any skills root the skill tool scans:

* ``{SKILLS_DIR}``                     — global, from settings
* ``{workspace}/.openagentd/skills/``  — project-local (OpenAgentd-native)
* ``{workspace}/.agents/skills/``      — project-local (universal .agents)
* ``{workspace}/.opencode/skills/``    — project-local (opencode reuse)

The ``discover_skills`` cache in ``app.agent.tools.builtin.skill`` is
mtime-keyed, so it self-heals on the next call, but eagerly clearing
the LRU avoids relying on filesystem mtime granularity (1s on most
platforms) when the agent writes a skill and immediately validates it
in the same turn.

Kept in this module (not in the skill module itself) to avoid pulling
``functools.lru_cache`` internals across module boundaries from fs-tool
imports, and to keep the dependency direction one-way:
filesystem tools → builtin.skill, never the reverse.
