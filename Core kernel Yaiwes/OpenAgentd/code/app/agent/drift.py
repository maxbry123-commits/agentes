"""Per-agent config-file mtime stamping and drift detection.

Lives in its own leaf module so that both ``app.agent.loader`` (which builds
agents and stamps their files) and ``app.agent.session`` (which
checks for drift each turn) can import it directly without a cycle.

A ``ConfigStamp`` is a dict of ``{absolute_path: mtime_ns | None}``.
``None`` means *tracked but absent*; the file appearing later still counts
as drift.  Calls to :func:`_stamp_path` swallow :class:`FileNotFoundError`
and log other :class:`OSError`s, so drift detection never fails the turn.
