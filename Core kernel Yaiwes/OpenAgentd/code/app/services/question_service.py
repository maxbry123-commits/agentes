"""Durable storage for ``ask_user`` suspensions.

When the agent calls ``ask_user`` its turn is suspended rather
than blocked: the loop stops, the activation exits, and *the conversation is
left in a resumable state on disk*.  Two rows make that work, written together
in one transaction by :func:`create_pending_question`:

``pending_questions``
    The question itself, so a restarted daemon (or a second device) can
    re-render the card and know the session is awaiting input.

placeholder ``ToolMessage``
    A stand-in result for the suspended tool call.  Without it the assistant
    message would carry a ``tool_call`` with no matching ``tool`` reply, and
    :func:`app.services.chat_service.heal_orphaned_tool_calls` — which runs on
    session start and after shell turns — would "heal" it into a synthetic
    *interrupted* result, silently destroying the suspension.

Resolution rewrites the placeholder **in place** with the user's answer, so the
resumed turn sees exactly one complete, ordinary tool result where it left off.
