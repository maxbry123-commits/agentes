"""In-memory SSE stream store.

Design
------
- _state: dict[session_id, TurnState]  — accumulated turn blob (reconnect replay)
- _subscribers: dict[session_id, list[asyncio.Queue]]  — live fan-out to SSE clients
- _cleanup tasks expire detached state after STREAM_TTL seconds and rotate the
  replay payload while live clients remain attached

Single-process only — no cross-worker fan-out. OpenAgentd's supported
sidecar and personal-server launchers intentionally run one Uvicorn worker;
do not start this app with ``--workers > 1`` because reconnect replay and live
subscribers must share this process-local store.
