"""Question fetch/answer/dismiss endpoints for ``ask_user``.

A suspended turn lives in the DB, not in a coroutine, so these routes work
after a reload, from a second device, and across a daemon restart:

``GET /{sid}/question``
    Cold-load the open question. Live clients normally get it from the
    replayed ``question_asked`` SSE event instead.

``POST /{sid}/question/{qid}/answer``
    Validate the reply, rewrite the placeholder tool result with it, then
    restart the lead's turn from exactly where it stopped.

``POST /{sid}/question/{qid}/dismiss``
    Close the question and leave the turn ended — no further model call.
