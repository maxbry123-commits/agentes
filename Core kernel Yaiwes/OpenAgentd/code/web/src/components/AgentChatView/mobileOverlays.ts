/**
 * mobileOverlays — the single-overlay rule for the mobile chat layout.
 *
 * On mobile every large surface (session sidebar, chat-actions menu,
 * coding workspace panel, session settings, scheduler, todos, files panel,
 * command palette) is a full-screen or near-full-screen overlay. Two open
 * at once is always a layering bug, so opening any one closes the rest.
 *
 * ``useUIStore`` enforces exclusion among scheduler / capabilities / palette
 * and ``useEdgeSwipe`` enforces it among the drawers; this module is the
 * cross-island bridge. The logic is a pure function so it can be unit-tested
 * without rendering ``AgentChatView``.
