/**
 * Shared query options for the two workspace file-listing endpoints.
 *
 * Both listings are served by the same backend walk: `git ls-files` when the
 * workspace is a git work tree, otherwise `os.walk` + a `.gitignore` match
 * (capped at 5,000 entries and offloaded to a worker thread because it stats
 * every entry). Every consumer must therefore share one cache entry per
 * workspace/session rather than fetching its own copy.
 *
 * Consumers: `WorkspaceFilesPanel` (artifacts tree), `CodingWorkspacePanel`
 * (coding file tree), the InputComposer `@`-mention picker (`useFileRefsQuery`), and
 * the coding command palette (`useCommandPalette`).
 *
 * Two invariants these factories exist to enforce:
 *
 * 1. **One key per endpoint.** The `workspace_files` / `coding_workspace`
 *    invalidations in `cache-invalidation-bridge.ts` target exactly these
 *    keys, so a consumer that invents its own key silently stops receiving
 *    post-write refreshes.
 * 2. **One cached shape per key.** Consumers that narrowed the payload (e.g.
 *    to `{ files }`) used to race the ones that stored the full response —
 *    whichever resolved last won, and fields like `truncated` became
 *    `undefined` for the other reader. Always cache the full response and let
 *    each consumer read the fields it needs.
 *
 * `staleTime` is deliberately *not* fixed here: it is a per-observer concern.
 * The always-visible trees use a short window; the on-demand pickers use a
 * longer one. Freshness after agent writes comes from explicit invalidation,
 * not from polling.
