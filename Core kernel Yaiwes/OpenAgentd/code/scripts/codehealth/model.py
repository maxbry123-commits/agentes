"""Shared data model for code-health reports.

A single ``FileReport`` describes one source file across both ecosystems.
Language-specific analyzers (``py_analyzer``, ``ts_analyzer``) populate the
fields they can compute; everything downstream (scoring, reporting, cycle
detection) is language-agnostic and consumes ``FileReport`` only.
