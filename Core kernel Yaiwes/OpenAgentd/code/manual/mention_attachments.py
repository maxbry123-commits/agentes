"""Smoke-test @-mention auto-attachment for team chat.

Sets up a temp coding workspace with fixtures, sends a chat message that
mentions a small text file, a large text file, an image, and a folder,
then reads:

  * the API history response — verifies attachment metadata (no internal
    fields leaked, no converted_text in the public response)
  * the DB directly — verifies synthetic hidden rows were written with
    the correct fenced content, and that file content / truncation
    markers are present in those rows

Checks:
  * note.txt   → attached, synthetic row has [File: note.txt] fence
  * big.txt    → attached, synthetic row truncated head+tail
  * photo.png  → NOT attached (image mentions are reference-only)
  * report.pdf / spec.docx → NOT attached (document mentions are Read-tool references)
  * subdir/    → resolved to subdir/AGENTS.md, synthetic row present
  * "@quoted.txt" (inside quotes) → still resolves

The queue-path branch (mentions when the lead is busy) is covered by
unit tests.

Usage:
  uv run python -m manual.mention_attachments
  uv run python -m manual.mention_attachments --base http://localhost:8000/api
