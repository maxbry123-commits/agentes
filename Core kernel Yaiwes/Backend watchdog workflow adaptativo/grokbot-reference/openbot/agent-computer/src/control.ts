 * control every acting call from the Bot is refused, because two drivers on one page is how a Bot
 * clicks "Confirm" on a form a human was still filling in.
 *
 * State lives in this process rather than in the server because this process owns the browser, and a
 * takeover that the browser does not know about is not a takeover. The server records it and decides
 * who may ask for it; this decides whether the next action happens.
 *
 * This module has no Playwright import, so state-machine tests do not need a browser. Browser work
 * stays in `index.ts`.
