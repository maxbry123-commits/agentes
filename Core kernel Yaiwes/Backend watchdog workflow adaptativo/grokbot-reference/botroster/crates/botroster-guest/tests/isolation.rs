//! The guest must have no code path that can read the credential store.
//!
//! This is risk #2 in `docs/SPEC.md`, and the mitigation there is structural:
//! not "reviewers will notice", but "the code to do it cannot be written". The
//! credential store is `botrosterd::secrets`, and the guest keeps away from it by
//! not depending on `botrosterd` at all. This test is what enforces that.
//!
//! The two model-facing crates are protected differently:
//!
//! * `botroster-agent` is protected by cargo. `botrosterd -> botroster-bots ->
//!   botroster-agent` already exists, so an edge back to `botrosterd` would be a
//!   dependency cycle and would not compile.
//! * `botroster-guest` is protected by nothing else. `botrosterd` does not depend on
//!   the guest, so there is no cycle to prevent it. Adding
//!   `botrosterd = { workspace = true }` to `crates/botroster-guest/Cargo.toml`
//!   compiles, passes every other test, and silently ends the guarantee, after
//!   which any tool in the sandbox is one `use` away from the tokens.
//!
//! The test reads the workspace's manifests and walks the internal dependency
//! graph, because the realistic way this breaks is not a direct edge someone
//! would notice in review but a shared helper crate that grows a `botrosterd`
//! dependency two hops away.
