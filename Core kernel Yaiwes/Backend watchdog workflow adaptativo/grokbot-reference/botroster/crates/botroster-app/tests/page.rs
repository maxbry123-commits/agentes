//! The page's own logic, driven in a real browser.
//!
//! `ui/main.js` holds the approval queue, the session filter, the refusal
//! mapping, the permission editor and the credentials form: decisions with
//! security consequences, which need to be checked on every push.
//!
//! ## Why this shape
//!
//! Three alternatives were rejected:
//!
//! * Driving the real window over CDP works, but WebView2 speaks the DevTools
//!   protocol and webkit2gtk does not, so it is a Windows-only tool and CI
//!   would never run it.
//! * jsdom means adding a JavaScript toolchain to a Rust workspace for one
//!   file, plus a provenance row, plus a second engine whose quirks are not
//!   the ones a person's webview has.
//! * A `file://` page loses the origin behaviour the real page has.
//!
//! What is used instead is the browser this project already ships and already
//! tests with: the guest's Chromium, which CI installs and requires. The page
//! is served over loopback exactly as `botroster-guest`'s own browser tests serve
//! theirs.
//!
//! ## What is real and what is doubled
//!
//! The markup and the script are the shipped files, read off disk. Only
//! `window.__TAURI__` is a double: the IPC boundary. Every `invoke` is
//! recorded so a test can assert what the page sent, and `__fire` delivers an
//! event the way Tauri would, so what is under test is the page's response
//! rather than the stub.
