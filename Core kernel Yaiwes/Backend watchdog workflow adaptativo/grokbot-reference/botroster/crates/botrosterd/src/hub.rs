//! The Computer Hub: one WebSocket per peer, JSON-RPC 2.0 on top.
//!
//! Two peer roles connect here. A harness (the agent) calls tools; a
//! tool server (the guest daemon, an MCP bridge) owns and executes them.
//! The hub authorises each socket once at upgrade, then routes between them.
//!
//! Routing, end to end:
//!
//! ```text
//! harness                    hub                       tool server
//!   │ session_open ─────────► mint SessionId
//!   │ session_bind_server ──► session.bind ──────────────►│
//!   │                       ◄──────────── SessionBindResult (tool snapshot)
//!   │ ◄──── SessionBindServerResult
//!   │ tool.call ───────────► tool_call_request ──────────►│
//!   │ ◄──── tool_call_progress ◄──── tool_call_progress ──│  (0..n, relayed)
//!   │ ◄──── result           ◄──────────────── result ────│  (exactly 1)
//! ```
//!
//! The hub rewrites JSON-RPC ids when forwarding so it can correlate a reply
//! back to the originating request, and keeps a `call_id → origin` map so
//! progress notifications reach the right harness.

/// as this user reads `hub.token` exactly as the desktop client does, and
