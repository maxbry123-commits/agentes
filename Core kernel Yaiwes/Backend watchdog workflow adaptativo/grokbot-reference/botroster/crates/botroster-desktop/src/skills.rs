//! Saved procedures a Bot can look up, for the composer's `/`.
//!
//! Typing `/` references a saved skill by name. A person picks one from a
//! list rather than remembering what they called it, so the client's job is
//! to offer the names that actually work.
//!
//! That is why the files that failed to load travel with the catalog. A skill
//! that does not parse is not in `botroster skill ls`'s working set and a Bot
//! ignores it silently: the file is on disk and the procedure is never
//! followed. A menu built from the working set alone would hide that, so the
//! catalog carries both and the caller decides: offer the ones that load, and
//! say that the others exist.
