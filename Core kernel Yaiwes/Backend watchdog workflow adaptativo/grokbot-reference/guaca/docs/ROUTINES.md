# Routines

A routine is an instruction an agent gives itself when a trigger comes due.
`domain/routine.rs` holds the shape, the scheduler is in `runtime/mod.rs`, and
`RoutineList` and `RoutineDetail` draw them. `lib/routine.ts` is the webview's
half: the only file on that side that reads a trigger's stored text.

## A trigger is one string, in both places it lives, and two kinds of thing

The column is text and so is the wire form, which is why `Trigger` has a
hand-written `Serialize`: a derived one would hand the webview a tagged object
and SQLite `weekdays` for the same fact, and only one of the two would be read
by the frontend.

Underneath that one string are two families. A `Cadence` is a moment or a repeat
of them, and the scheduler owns it. An `EventTrigger` is something happening in
a service the group is connected to, written `event:stripe/invoice.payment_failed`,
and it owns nothing: it has no next moment, and no clock will ever produce one.
Splitting them in the type is what keeps `next_after`, `first_run` and `accepts`
off a value that has no answer for any of them.

What delivers one is a POST. `webhook.rs` is a loopback receiver, and
`/events/stripe/invoice.payment_failed` on it fires every active routine
standing on that trigger through `Runtime::deliver_event`, which asks the same
three things the clock's sweep asks, in the same order: is the agent working
and does the routine skip, move the row, write the firing down. The body of the
post rides on the fired part as `payload` and reaches the model below the
instruction, fenced and named as data. Nothing polls a service and nothing
signs in to one for this: whatever posts is the operator's to wire, and the
routine's panel shows the address and the secret it takes. The trigger is in
the picker now for exactly that reason. It was kept out until something could
deliver one, because a routine an operator can set and then watch never fire is
worse than one they cannot set yet.

## The receiver is loopback, and the secret is in a header because of that

Loopback is what the two viewers are, and it is enough for them because reading
a page an agent drew changes nothing. A post here starts a turn, so loopback is
not enough: any page open in the operator's browser can POST to a loopback port
cross-origin, and a secret carried in the body rides along in such a post
unread. The secret is a bearer token in `Authorization`, and that placement is
the mechanism. A browser will not attach that header cross-origin without a
preflight, the preflight is answered with no CORS headers at all, and the POST
is never sent. A secret in a query string or a body would look identical to a
reader and close nothing.

The port and the secret are written into the settings the first time the
receiver comes up and read back on every launch after, because the operator
wires something to an address once. A receiver that took a fresh port from the
OS every morning would break that wiring every morning with nothing on screen
to say so. A recorded port that is taken is not fatal either: the receiver takes
a free one, says so in the log, and writes the new one down. The panel shows
whichever address is current, and a port of zero, which is a receiver that did
not come up at all, is drawn as that sentence rather than as an address nothing
answers.

An event nobody stands on is a 404, and that is the answer that matters most. A
200 would tell a script its wiring works while the routine it was meant for sits
under a different spelling. The service is lowered on both sides for the same
reason: a routine set as `stripe` hears from a webhook configured as `Stripe`.
The body is drained before a refusal is written, because a client still sending
when the answer arrives reads a reset instead of the sentence that says what it
did wrong.

The `schedule` tool still reads a cadence and nothing else. An agent that
improvised `event:...` there would hold a routine waiting on a post nobody has
arranged, and it has no way to tell whoever might post where to post to. The
operator sets these, and the agent reads them in its prompt like any other.

## A routine with no next firing has no next firing

`next_run_at` is `Option<i64>`, and NULL in SQLite since migration 21. The
alternative was a sentinel date, which is a date the operator eventually gets
shown, and one bad comparison away from firing something that was meant to wait
for Stripe. NULL also tells the scheduler for free: SQL compares NULL to
nothing, so `next_run_at <= now` skips these without `due_routines` knowing what
kinds of trigger exist.

Everything reading that column has to answer for the empty case rather than
invent a moment. `NextSlot` is the shape of that: `Due`, `Waiting` and `Done`
are three answers, not two, because "nothing on the clock" and "finished" mean
opposite things to the row and reading them off the same `None` deleted every
event routine the first time it fired. `ORDER BY next_run_at` needs the same
care: NULL sorts first in SQLite, so a routine waiting on an event drew above
one firing in ten minutes.

Migration 21 rebuilds the table, which is the only way SQLite will drop NOT
NULL. `migrations::run` turns foreign key enforcement off around the whole
sequence for it: with enforcement on, `DROP TABLE routines` performs an implicit
delete first and fires `routine_runs`' `ON DELETE CASCADE`, taking every
recorded firing with it.

## A repeat is a shape, not a number of seconds

`every weekday` and `every month` cannot be gaps, and `every day` should not be
one: a day is 23 or 25 hours twice a year, so a daily nine o'clock routine
stored as 86400 seconds drifts to eight and stays there. `Cadence` holds the
shape and `next_run_at` holds the hour, and the next slot is computed in local
time from the slot it was due at rather than from the moment it ran, so a
machine asleep through three of them fires once on waking instead of three
times. A gap still exists, because an agent scheduling itself works in seconds
and nothing shorter than a day has an hour to keep.

## The moment is the only record of which day a repeat keeps

A weekly routine keeps the weekday of its first firing and a monthly one keeps
the day of the month. Neither is stored anywhere else, and for a while neither
was askable: the panel offered a time of day, so "every week at nine" landed on
whichever day the operator happened to be at the keyboard, and nothing on screen
said so. `anchorFor` in `lib/routine.ts` says which part of a moment each trigger
actually keeps, and `firstRunDelay` turns what the operator picked into the one
number the backend takes.

Two rules in there are not obvious. A monthly 31st goes to the next month that
*has* a 31st rather than clamping to the end of a short one, because clamping
would anchor the routine on the 28th and every firing after it would inherit
that day: the walk backward down the calendar `months_after` is careful to
avoid. And a moment already gone is refused rather than sent, because a negative
delay reaches the scheduler as a routine overdue and fires on the next tick,
which is not what picking a date means. A one-off takes a date for the same
reason: a time on its own can only ever mean the next 24 hours.

## Switching a routine off and editing one are different actions

`active` has its own command, acts on the click, and does not move
`next_run_at`: a routine turned back on is due at the slot it was already
holding, and the scheduler fires an overdue slot once. Parking it behind a Save
the operator has not pressed means a routine they think they stopped still runs.

## A firing can be skipped, which is not the same as deferred

`skip_if_working` is one column and one question, asked at the moment a routine
comes due: is this agent already working? If it is, nothing is delivered, the
slot moves on exactly as it would have if the firing had happened, and the
history records a skip. The next one comes at its usual time.

The alternative reading is deferral, and it is the wrong one. An hourly sweep
held until the agent goes quiet fires the moment it does, which is the pile-up
the option exists to prevent, only later and in a bunch. Skipping is the
operator saying this particular firing was not worth queueing.

Which is also why it is refused on anything that does not repeat. Skipping
moves the slot on, and the slot a one-off holds is the only one it has: the row
would be deleted having done nothing, and the operator would find an empty list
where their alarm used to be. `validate` refuses the pair where somebody asks
for it outright, and the panel does not draw the tick on a one-off at all,
which is why `draftOf` drops the flag rather than sending it: a routine ticked
as a repeat and then switched to Once would otherwise fail to save with its
reason attached to a control nobody can see.

"Already working" is `Activity::is_working`, read off the same map the dot
beside the agent's name is drawn from, so what the operator sees and what the
scheduler decided are one fact rather than two that agree. Idle is the only
state that is not working: a queue that is not empty is work already waiting, a
permission request is a turn parked mid-flight, and a paused agent takes
nothing off its inbox at all. An agent with no entry in the map has no actor
and is not working, because a routine that does not run is invisible in a way
one that runs is not, and the failure worth having is the noisy one.

One path deliberately does not consult it. Test run is the operator pressing a
button, and a test that quietly did nothing would read as the button being
broken. The receiver does consult it, through the same `working` read the sweep
uses, because the column would otherwise be true on an event routine and mean
nothing: a burst of posts landing on an agent mid-turn is the same pile-up the
option exists to prevent, arriving from the other direction.

## A skipped firing is in the history, and has no run behind it

`RunKind` has a third value and `routine_runs.run_id` is nullable since
migration 34. A fourth, `event`, is a post that was delivered; it is kept apart
from `scheduled` because the two answer different questions when a routine
misbehaves. A scheduled firing at the wrong hour is the cadence, and an event
firing nobody expected is whatever is posting to the receiver. Both halves are the same argument. A firing that leaves no trace
is a gap in the history, and a gap is also what a scheduler that has stopped
working looks like; but a skip recorded under an invented run id reads back as
a delivery that bought no model calls, which is the *other* failure this
history exists to name, and it has a different fix. So the row says which of
the two it was, and the panel draws "skipped, already working" where it would
otherwise draw "nothing ran".

A fast cadence on a busy agent fills the list with skips. That is the news
rather than noise: a sweep being passed over ten times running is worth seeing,
and the operator's move is to change the cadence.

## An agent reads its own schedule before it decides to write another one

Every routine an agent has standing is in its system prompt, with the id of
each, its cadence and the first line of its instruction. `schedule` with `list`
still gives the full text, and the prompt says so.

It is in the prompt rather than behind that tool call because of when the two
arrive. An operator books something, comes back half an hour later and asks for
it differently without saying which routine they mean: "make that every day".
The agent had no idea it kept anything, so nothing in the turn prompted it to go
and look, and it wrote a second routine beside the first with a name one word
different. It reported that it had made the change. Both fired from then on, and
the operator found out by reading the panel. A list an agent has to ask for is a
list it reads *after* deciding what to do; a list in the prompt is one it reads
before.

What is in the row is chosen for recognition rather than for reading. An
instruction is written to be acted on with no other context, so it runs to
several sentences, and ten of them drawn in full would be the largest section of
the prompt with the rule underneath them the part that got skimmed. A routine
the operator has switched off says so instead of counting down: it still holds
the slot it was holding, and an agent told a dead routine fires in an hour
reports work as in hand that nobody is going to do.

## Changing a routine is `update`, and adding a second one is not

`schedule` had `list`, `add` and `cancel`. There was no verb for "the routine
you already have, differently", so an agent asked for one could only add, or
cancel and add, and canceling first means losing the wording it was keeping if
the second call is refused. `update` takes an id and any of a name, an
instruction, a repeat or a delay, and leaves every field it was not sent alone.
That last part is the whole point: making an agent restate the instruction in
order to move the clock is how a second routine gets written.

Where the next firing lands after an edit is `next_slot_for`, in `domain`, and
it is the same function the operator's panel uses. Two answers to "when is this
next due" would be two schedules.

An `add` that lands beside a routine already doing the same job says so, in the
tool's own answer, naming both ids. It is a notice and not a refusal, and it
must not become one: nothing in the runtime can tell "move the sweep to ten"
from "sweep at ten as well", because both arrive as the same instruction on a
different clock. A guard would refuse honest work, and an agent's way around a
refusal is to reword the instruction until it gets through. Saying it out loud
reaches the one party that knows which was meant, while the turn is still
running. `same_job` is deliberately loose for the same reason: a false positive
costs a sentence the turn can ignore.

## A schedule changing is its own event, and the panel was not listening for one

Every path that writes a routine row emits `RoutinesChanged`, carrying the agent
whose schedule it was: the agent's own `schedule` tool, the operator's commands,
and the scheduler advancing a routine it has just fired. `RoutineList` reads
itself again when the id it is drawing comes up.

The operator commands used to emit `AgentsChanged`, which is a claim about the
roster, and nothing drawing a schedule was listening for it: the list survived
on being remounted by its key when the detail panel closed. So an agent that
booked a routine mid-turn left the operator reading a list drawn before the
routine existed, and the only way to see it was to close the panel and open it
again. The same held for a firing: a routine that had just run still showed the
countdown it had before, and a one-shot that fired stayed on the list until
something else redrew it.

## A test run is the scheduler's own path with the schedule left alone

Same delivery, same fresh run, so what the button shows is what Tuesday will do.
It deliberately does not move `next_run_at` or delete a one-shot, because trying
a routine out must not spend the only firing it had. It is refused while the
draft is dirty: firing the saved version while the operator is looking at an
edited one answers a different question and reads as the edit having done
nothing. Both kinds are recorded in `routine_runs` and the test is marked,
because in the transcript the two are identical.

## A firing that spent nothing is a routine that did not run

`routine_runs` records that a firing happened. What the operator actually wants
to know is whether it worked, and a delivery to an agent that never took a turn
is indistinguishable, row for row, from one that did the job. So the history
joins `usage` by `run_id` and every firing carries what it bought: `calls: 0` is
the one worth seeing.

Joined at read time rather than stored on the row, because a firing's cost is
not known when it is recorded and keeps moving until the run settles. A column
would be a snapshot of a number that was still changing, and the model calls are
already filed under the run id.

## A routine's row is one line and its instruction is not in it

The instruction is written to be acted on with no other context, which is
several sentences, and drawing it as the title made one routine fill the panel.
The row is a name and a cadence; opening it gives the panel over to that
routine. An agent naming its own routine is optional, so `routineTitle` cuts the
instruction down when nobody named it, on a word boundary and after the first
sentence.

The end of that second line is where the row is honest about what it is looking
at. A switched-off routine must not claim a next firing, and one waiting on an
event has no next firing to claim, so both say when they last ran instead: on a
routine that is not about to do anything, that is the only news left.

## A firing is a line in the transcript, not a message

The instruction has to reach the model, and it does: the envelope carries
`Part::Routine`, `as_plain_text` returns the instruction, and prompt assembly,
dedup and the emptiness check are all unchanged. What the part buys is the
drawing. A firing used to arrive as a chat bubble from "Guaca" carrying all
several sentences of it, in the middle of the operator's own conversation with
their agent: the system prompting the agent, in the shape of somebody talking to
the reader. The reflex is to read it as addressed to you, and it never is.

So it is one chip naming the routine, and the click opens that routine in the
panel beside the transcript, where the instruction is the thing you came to
read. The part carries the routine's id and its name *at the time it fired*, so
a routine since renamed does not rewrite what the transcript said it was. The
two ends are in different columns of the window, so the click goes through
`openingRoutine` in the store rather than a prop threaded through every message,
which is the same arrangement `focused` already uses for search hits.

Old transcripts still hold text parts and still draw as bubbles. Migrations are
forward-only and a message is a record of what happened; rewriting one to change
how it looks is not worth being able to say the record was edited.

## What a routine delivers is work, and the runtime is what sent it

It arrives from neither the operator nor a peer, which is the case the reply
mode originally had no arm for: every schedule an agent kept was answered by an
agent that had just been told nothing was being asked of it. Anything carrying
work with nobody to answer is `ReplyMode::Assigned`, whoever sent it; work from
a peer answers that peer instead. See *Cascades terminate because of one
asymmetry* in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
