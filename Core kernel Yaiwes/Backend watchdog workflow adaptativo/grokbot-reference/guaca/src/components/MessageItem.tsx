/**
 * What an agent did on its own turn: guard stops, and the tools it reached for.
 *
 * Sends are not here. They are traffic between two agents however they were
 * made, so `transcriptRows` lifts them out of the record and into the burst
 * row, leaving this the trail around them. A send that named nobody does stay,
 * because there is no peer to file it under and the reason it went nowhere is
 * the whole of what there is to see.
 *
 * Tool calls are drawn as one row per run of them rather than one row each: a
 * turn can make two dozen, and a line apiece buried the operator's own
 * conversation exactly as peer traffic did before it was collapsed. A notice
 * ends the run it interrupts, for the reason a tool trail ends a burst in
 * `transcriptRows`: the notice is usually about the calls either side of it,
 * and folding across it would put the explanation somewhere other than the
 * thing it explains.
 *
 * Text reaches here in one case: a turn that answered its peer through
 * `send_message` and then carried on typing. That text has no recipient, so it
 * is drawn as an aside rather than as anything addressed to the operator.
 *
 * A `json` part is the one kind that reaches here and draws nothing, and it is
 * still the case that nothing in the runtime emits one. It used to be described
 * here as the seam a model-authored artifact would arrive through; artifacts
 * arrived, and they came through the text instead. A chart or a page is a
 * fenced block in the reply, which costs no round trip and needs no new part:
 * `lib/figure.ts`. A renderer for `json` before there is a producer is still
 * surface with no caller.
