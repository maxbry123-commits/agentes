/**
 * What the stylesheet has to keep being true.
 *
 * Every other suite here renders components into jsdom, which does no layout,
 * so a rule that lays a surface out wrongly passes all of them. Two defects in
 * the file reading view were exactly that shape: it clipped the document it
 * existed to show and could not be scrolled, and it opened at the width of an
 * ordinary dialog. Neither is visible in a DOM assertion and neither is
 * visible in review, so both are asserted here against the cascade itself.
 *
 * Only invariants that survive a redesign belong in this file. A color, a
 * spacing or a font size is a decision, not a rule, and locking one down here
 * would make changing your mind a test failure.
 *
 * The closed sets below are the one thing that reads like an exception and is
 * not. Nothing here says 13px is the right size for a second line. It says a
 * size is *named*, so that changing your mind means editing one token and
 * seeing every rule that shares the decision move with it. Spelled at the
 * point of use, a decision is invisible: this file reached 41 font sizes, 38
 * of them inside ten pixels, with a considered color system sitting at the top
 * of it the whole time. Nobody chose that and no review would have caught it.
