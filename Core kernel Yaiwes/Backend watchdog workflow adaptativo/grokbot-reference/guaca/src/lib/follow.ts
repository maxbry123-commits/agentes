/**
 * Keeps a transcript's newest line in view, and stops the moment the operator
 * looks away from it.
 *
 * Following the end is only ever wanted by somebody who is already at the end.
 * Anyone else is reading, and moving the page under a reader is the one thing
 * this must not do: an agent writing four hundred tokens is four hundred
 * chances to throw them back to the end of a cascade they were half way up.
 *
 * **Where the operator is, is not what a scroll event says.** A scroll event is
 * delivered after the fact, and a token committing in between arrives first. So
 * a wheel tick up, a token, and then the event, in that order: the transcript
 * is already back on the floor by the time anything is told the operator left
 * it, and the next tick starts the same race. That is the reported bug. Under
 * streaming text a trackpad could not climb out of the transcript at all, and
 * the eighty-pixel threshold this replaced only set the size of the pit.
 *
 * So the offset is compared rather than listened for. This hook remembers the
 * offset it wrote, and before writing again it checks the box is still there.
 * Above it, somebody else moved it, and that somebody is the operator: let go,
 * and leave the box alone. There is no window for a token to land in, because
 * the check and the write are the same statement.
 *
 * Scroll events keep one job, and it has no race in it: noticing the operator
 * come back. Nothing is following and nothing is being written by then, so a
 * late event costs nothing, and arriving at the end is worth being generous
 * about. Stopping a few pixels short of the end while scrolling down is
 * arriving at the end, and a transcript that then refuses to follow reads as
 * broken in the other direction.
 *
 * **The end also moves when nothing arrives.** Everything under a transcript
 * takes its height from the transcript: the composer growing a line as a
 * message is typed, a turn's chips landing, the working panel opening, the
 * window dragged shorter. Nothing scrolls and no content arrives, so neither
 * of the routes above fires, and the newest line goes under the fold and stays
 * there until the next token happens to land. So the box is watched for a
 * change of its own size, and that is the third and last thing that writes
 * here. It answers to the same question as the other two, which is whether the
 * operator is at the end.
