/**
 * The one preferences blob, read back out of a file the operator can edit.
 *
 * `readPrefs` validates field by field, and the reason is that every route this
 * blob takes into the app is a route it can arrive wrong on: an older build
 * wrote fewer fields, a newer one wrote more, a webview torn down mid-write
 * left half a string, and a curious operator edited it by hand. What is under
 * test here is that each of those costs exactly the fields it got wrong and
 * never the window. A scale that is not one of the offered scales becomes a CSS
 * length no button can turn back off; a notify flag that was coerced rather
 * than checked is either an interruption the operator never switched off or one
 * they asked for and will not get.
