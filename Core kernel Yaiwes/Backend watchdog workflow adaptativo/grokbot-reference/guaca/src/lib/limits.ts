/**
 * The five bounds a conversation runs inside, as they are written for a person.
 *
 * Here rather than in the dialog that first drew them, because they are now set
 * in two places: app-wide in Settings, and per crew in a group. Two copies of
 * this list would drift, and what drifts is the sentence explaining a number
 * whose consequence is money.
 *
 * The ranges are the ones `GuardLimits::sanitized` clamps to. They are advisory
 * here, since a typed or pasted number sails past a `max` on an input, and the
 * runtime clamps whatever arrives, which is why both dialogs read their limits
 * back after saving rather than leaving what was typed on screen.
