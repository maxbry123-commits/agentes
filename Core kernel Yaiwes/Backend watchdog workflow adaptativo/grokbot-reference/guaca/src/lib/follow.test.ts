 * the end of it, at times nobody could name. Two of them were nameable. A
 * channel reopened after a pair thread was listening for scrolls on a node
 * that had already been thrown away, so it never learned the operator had
 * moved at all; and the eighty-pixel threshold it used when it did work could
 * not be climbed out of while text was arriving, because every frame put the
 * view back on the floor before the next wheel tick was counted.
 *
 * jsdom does no layout, so the box is measured here instead. `scrollTop`
 * clamps and fires a scroll event exactly as a real one does, which is what
 * these rules are made of.
