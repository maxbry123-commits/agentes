//! What a credential actually reaches, against the real service.

//! The scripted suites prove the plumbing: a secret goes into the environment
//! of a sandbox command and never anywhere else. They cannot prove the thing an
//! operator cares about, which is that an agent handed a key can do the work the
//! key is for. That needs the real machine and the real API, so it costs money
//! and lives behind `#[ignore]`.
//!
//! Run with `./scripts/connectors.sh`.
//!
//! The credential is read from the app's own database and put into the sandbox
//! the way the runtime puts it there. It is never printed, never asserted on,
//! and never written to the sandbox's disk: if one of these tests fails, the
//! output says which step failed and not what the token was.
