//! Evals: whether a crew communicates like something worth watching.
//!
//! The cascade suite asks whether the runtime does what it was told. This asks
//! a different question: given an instruction an operator would actually type,
//! is the resulting traffic reasonable? Every cascade defect this app has had
//! passed the first suite and failed the second, because each individual
//! message was correct and the shape was not.
//!
//! Scenarios come in two kinds.
//!
//! The scripted ones run against a stub model that plays a specific bad habit
//! on purpose: the eternally polite agent, the one that answers three times,
//! the one that broadcasts twice. They are deterministic, free, and they check
//! that the runtime contains the habit rather than that a model happens not to
//! have it today. These run in CI.
//!
//! The live ones run against whatever model is configured and ask whether the
//! prompts hold up. They cost money and cannot be deterministic, so they are
//! `#[ignore]`d and run with `./scripts/evals.sh`. A prompt change that makes
//! agents chattier will not fail CI; it will fail here, which is the point.
