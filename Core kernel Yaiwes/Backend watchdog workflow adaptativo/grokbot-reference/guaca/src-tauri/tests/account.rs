//! End-to-end tests for signing in to a Guaca account.
//!
//! A scripted authorization server, and the real [`Account`] driven against it:
//! discovery, the loopback listener, the PKCE challenge, the redirect, the
//! exchange, and the first call the token is spent on. Nothing is stubbed
//! inside the module, because the failures worth catching here are all seams.
//! `account.rs`'s own unit tests cover what can be decided without a network,
//! and every one of them would pass with the flow never completing.
//!
//! The stub asserts the parts of the protocol the service is holding up its end
//! of: a challenge is sent and it is S256, the client is the public one, the
//! redirect is loopback, and the verifier presented at the token endpoint
//! actually hashes to the challenge that was sent. A regression in the last one
//! is a sign-in that still works and no longer proves anything.
//!
//! It also has the shape of the real service rather than the simplest one. Its
//! authorization server is mounted under `/api/auth`, so the issuer it publishes
//! is not its origin, and it names that issuer in the redirect. A stub at the
//! root agreed with a substitution the app was making, and passed every test in
//! this file while every sign-in against `guaca.bot` was refused.
