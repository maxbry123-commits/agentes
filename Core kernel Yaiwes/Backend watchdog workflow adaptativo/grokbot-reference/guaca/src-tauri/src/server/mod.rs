//! The server host: the same runtime, reached over HTTP and a socket.
//!
//! This is the second of two hosts. `app.rs` puts the runtime behind a window
//! on the operator's machine; this puts it on a box that stays awake when they
//! close their laptop. Everything between the two is identical, and that is the
//! design rather than a coincidence: `boot.rs` opens the workspace, `ipc.rs`
//! lists the commands, and neither of them knows which host it is in.
//!
//! ## It cannot tell whose box it is on
//!
//! An operator rents a machine, or guaca.ai hands them one. This module cannot
//! distinguish those and must not learn how: the difference is who pressed the
//! button at the provider, which is a fact about the bill. Keeping it out is
//! what makes bring-your-own-box free rather than a second product with a
//! second code path to fall out of step.
//!
//! ## Two shapes, because that is what a webview already spoke
//!
//! Tauri's IPC is "a name, some named arguments, and a value or a structured
//! error" plus one event channel the runtime pushes into. Those are a POST and
//! a WebSocket. Nothing above [`crate::ipc::dispatch`] learns which arrived, so
//! there is no second API to keep in step, and `ipc.contract.test.ts` fails the
//! build if the two transports ever answer to different sets of names.
//!
//! ## What guards it
//!
//! One bearer token, compared in constant time, on every route but health. The
//! workspace behind it holds inference keys, plugin refresh tokens and an
//! operator's transcripts, so there is no anonymous mode and no read-only mode:
//! a caller is the operator or it is nobody.
//!
//! The socket takes the token in the query string as well as the header,
//! because a browser cannot set headers on a WebSocket handshake. That is a
//! real cost (a query string reaches proxy logs, which a header does not), and
//! it is why the token is per-workspace and rotatable rather than derived from
//! anything longer-lived.
