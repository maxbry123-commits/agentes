//! What the menu bar says.
//!
//! The presence in the top right of the screen exists for the time the window
//! is not in front of you. Guaca keeps working then: routines fire, cascades
//! run, a turn parks on a permission request and waits ten minutes for an
//! answer. The strip is the one place that can say so without being opened.
//!
//! Three channels, and they are not interchangeable, which is the whole design:
//!
//!   the glyph     state, without being looked at. Outline, filled, or red.
//!   the title     the count of turns blocked on the operator, and nothing
//!                 else. Menu bar width is shared with every other app, so a
//!                 number that is always there is noise; one that appears only
//!                 when an agent is parked is information.
//!   the tooltip   one line, on hover. The glance that costs no click.
//!   the menu      the whole picture, and the answers.
//!
//! The picture is drawn by crew wherever a crew is worth naming, because two
//! crews can hold two agents with the same name and the same face: a row that
//! says only that Scout is thinking is a row an operator with two Scouts cannot
//! act on. Naming stops the moment there is one crew to name, which is the rule
//! the window's own crews' column is drawn by. `src/lib/presence.ts`.
//!
//! Nothing here knows Tauri exists. This file decides what the strip says and
//! `tray.rs` draws it, which is what makes every judgment below arguable in a
//! test rather than by opening the app and squinting at the corner.
