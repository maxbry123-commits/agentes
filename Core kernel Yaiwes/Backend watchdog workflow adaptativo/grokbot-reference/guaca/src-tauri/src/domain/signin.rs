//! What an agent is already signed in to.
//!
//! Not something an operator types. Whatever is holding the cookies knows, so
//! Guaca asks it rather than asking the person, and an agent that got signed in
//! ten seconds ago advertises it on the roster without anybody recording
//! anything.
//!
//! Two things can be holding them, and the rule below is shared by both because
//! it is a fact about the web rather than about where a browser runs. A computer
//! keeps its cookies in a file, read off the disk by `sessions.py`; a hosted
//! browser is asked over the DevTools protocol by `cdp.rs`. Both arrive here as
//! a `BrowserState`, and both are recorded against the `Surface` they came from,
//! because a session on one is not reachable from the other.
//!
//! The hard part is not reading cookies, it is deciding what a cookie means.
//! Two failure modes, both observed on a real machine while this was written:
//!
//! - **Ad-tech noise.** A profile that has browsed for an hour holds a thousand
//!   cookies across three hundred domains, and the obvious heuristic, a durable
//!   `httpOnly` cookie, is true of `adnxs.com`, `360yield.com` and forty other
//!   trackers nobody has an account with.
//! - **Present but signed out.** `google.com` sets `NID` and `AEC` on a browser
//!   that has never seen a Google account. Reporting a domain because cookies
//!   exist for it would have told an agent it could read Gmail when it could
//!   not, which is worse than saying nothing: it declines *after* wasting a
//!   turn, and the operator sees a broken account rather than an absent one.
//!
//! So detection is deliberately conservative, in two layers:
//!
//! 1. A table of services whose session cookie is known by name. `li_at` means
//!    LinkedIn, `user_session` means GitHub. A domain in this table is judged
//!    only by its signature: no signature, no claim, and no falling through to
//!    the guesswork below. That is what keeps `google.com` honest.
//! 2. For everything else, a domain is reported only if the browser has
//!    actually *been* there, which is what separates a site from a tracker: an
//!    ad network sets cookies from inside someone else's page and never appears
//!    in history.
//!
//! Cookie values are never read, anywhere. The name and the flags are the whole
//! signal, and a session token is exactly the thing this file must not handle.
