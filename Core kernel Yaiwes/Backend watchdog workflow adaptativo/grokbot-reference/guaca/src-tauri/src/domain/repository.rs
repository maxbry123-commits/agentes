//! Repositories: the directories an agent may write code in.
//!
//! A repository is one thing and carries one decision. The thing is a directory
//! on this machine that is the root of a git work tree. The decision is which of
//! the crew's agents works in it, and each of them works in at most one.
//!
//! ## There is no engineer, and that is the design
//!
//! The obvious shape is a tier: mark an agent a specialist, or an engineer, and
//! let the marked ones write code. It was not built, because the mark carries
//! no information the grant does not already carry. An engineer with no
//! repository and an ordinary agent with no repository are the same agent: both
//! are offered nothing that reaches a working tree and neither can make one.
//! A tier on top of that is a second answer to "what may this agent do", and
//! the two would have to be kept in step by hand.
//!
//! It also cannot be refused usefully. Every refusal in this app names what
//! happened and what to do about it, because a model reads it mid-turn.
//! "You are not an engineer" is a fact about a category; "no repository has
//! been given to you, and only the operator can give you one" is a fact the
//! agent can act on and put in its reply.
//!
//! What a tier feels like it would buy is already content rather than runtime.
//! `cafeteria.ts` ships a Software Engineer, a Code Reviewer and a QA Tester,
//! `roles.ts` scores an agent's own words into OpenRouter's `programming`
//! category, and both work today. Designating an engineer is hiring one and
//! giving it a repository. Nothing in the runtime has to know the word.
//!
//! ## An agent works in at most one, and that is about coordination
//!
//! Not permissions. The question a many-to-many answered was "who is allowed in
//! here", and the question this one answers is "who owns this codebase", which
//! is the one an operator actually has.
//!
//! Two agents on one repository settle a change between themselves, in the crew
//! they already share, with messages the operator can read. One agent quietly
//! holding two repositories is a change whose shape nobody can see until it
//! lands in both, and there is no conversation anywhere that says it was
//! coming. The cost is real and it is the intended one: a change that spans two
//! codebases is now two agents talking, which is the thing this app is for.
//!
//! It is a column on the agent rather than a table between the two, because
//! "at most one" is the rule and a column is the only shape that cannot
//! represent anything else. It is also what makes the rail a tree: a repository
//! is a heading with its agents under it, each drawn once, which a
//! many-to-many cannot be.
//!
//! A repository the operator has linked and given to nobody is an ordinary
//! state and is drawn as one. Nothing is inherited: an agent hired next week
//! starts in no repository, like every other capability in this app.
//!
//! ## The path is the root, and git is why
//!
//! A repository has to be a git work tree, and the linked directory has to be
//! its root. The requirement is not ceremony about tooling: git is the undo.
//! Everything an agent does in there is recoverable exactly because a diff, a
//! branch and a revert exist, and that is what makes handing a directory over
//! at all defensible.
//!
//! The root specifically, because the boundary and the undo have to be the same
//! directory. Linked at a subdirectory, an agent writes inside its boundary
//! while `git status` reports a tree it cannot see all of, and a revert reaches
//! outside the boundary to fix it. One directory, one repository, one undo.
//! Narrowing an agent to part of a repository is a sentence in [`Repository::note`],
//! which the model reads, not a second boundary that only half exists.
//!
//! The check itself is I/O and lives in [`crate::repo`]. This module holds the
//! shape and the rules that need no filesystem.
