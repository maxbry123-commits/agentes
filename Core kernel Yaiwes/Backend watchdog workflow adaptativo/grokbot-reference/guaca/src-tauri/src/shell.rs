//! One shell line, in a directory on this machine, with two bounds on it.
//!
//! This is the second way into a repository and the small one. [`crate::coding`]
//! is the other: a whole harness, in its own process, on its own budget, for
//! minutes at a time. That is the right unit for a change to a codebase and the
//! wrong unit for every question an agent has about the tree it is standing in.
//! Before this existed there was only the big one, and the shape of the failure
//! was consistent: an agent asked to merge a pull request either spent a coding
//! job on `gh pr merge`, or, when the harness would not start — a spent plan, a
//! program not installed, another job already in the work tree — reported to the
//! operator that it had no shell and no way to reach GitHub. Both are true
//! sentences about a design with one door in it.
//!
//! ## It is not a sandbox, and must never be described as one
//!
//! The line runs as the operator, in their directory, with their credentials
//! and their network. That is the same sentence `docs/CODING.md` writes under
//! *What is not here*, and it is not a widening: a coding job in that directory
//! already ran arbitrary commands as the operator, under
//! `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, with the operator's own MCP servers
//! loaded. What this adds is directness, not reach. What confines it is what
//! confined that: the directory the operator chose, and the fact that git can
//! undo what happens inside it.
//!
//! The one control that does apply is [`crate::domain::repository::Gate`], and
//! it applies here for the same reason it applies to a job. A push, a merge or
//! a release leaves the work tree under the operator's own name and git cannot
//! take it back. `Runtime::run_in_repository` asks `coding::bridge::outward`
//! about the line before running it, from the same function the `PreToolUse`
//! hook asks, so the two doors give the same answer to the same command. A gate
//! that read only one of them would be a gate an agent could walk around by
//! choosing the other tool.
//!
//! ## The two bounds
//!
//! A job has forty-five minutes because it is its own unit of work. This
//! happens *inside a turn*, so it has [`PATIENCE`], which is what an operator
//! will watch a reply take. And its output is what a model is about to be
//! charged for reading, so both ends are kept and the middle is counted and
//! dropped. Neither bound is confinement and neither is a security control;
//! they are what keeps one call from taking a turn or a context window with it.
