//! Running a coding harness against a linked repository.
//!
//! Guaca does not write code. It starts something that does, in a directory the
//! operator linked, and reads what comes back. Codex, Claude Code and `pi` each
//! own their model settings and credentials. The operator installs and signs in to whichever of
//! them they use.
//!
//! ## Why a harness and not tools
//!
//! A turn and a coding task are different units of work, and that is the whole
//! argument. A guaca turn is one model call plus `max_tool_rounds` rounds,
//! twenty-four by default, inside a conversation bounded at sixty model calls.
//! A real change to a repository is a few hundred tool calls, its own context
//! window and its own compaction. Reaching that with `read` and `edit` tools in
//! this runtime means raising both limits to coding scale, and both are per
//! group, so the guard that keeps a crew of eight from talking forever comes
//! off for every agent in every crew.
//!
//! So the harness keeps its own loop, its own context and its own budget, and
//! Guaca spends one tool round starting it.
//!
//! ## Why each harness is a program rather than a provider setting
//!
//! Because a subscription is spent by the program it was issued to. The
//! argument is in [`Harness`], and it is the reason this module is a dispatch
//! rather than a provider flag on a single command line.
//!
//! What they share is the shape of a job: one process, in one directory, whose
//! stdout is a stream of JSON objects, one per line. Pi and Claude share the
//! process lifecycle below, with their own arguments and event readers. Codex
//! owns a bidirectional app-server session in [`codex`], ending its process
//! after the active turn completes. All three return the same [`Outcome`].
//!
//! ## Why the credentials are not ours
//!
//! The harnesses read their own auth: `pi` from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` or the
//! environment, Codex and Claude Code from their own sign-ins. Each is already signed in or
//! it is not, and Guaca passing a key would put the operator's Guaca key on a
//! second bill under a second provider for work they are already paying for.
//! The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a job's spend does not appear
//! in this app's usage table, because this app did not spend it. What the job
//! reports back is what the harness says it cost.
//!
//! ## Claude Code and Codex jobs are reachable while they run
//!
//! `code` returns as soon as the process is up, which is what keeps the agent
//! that asked from reading as `Thinking` for the length of a change to a
//! codebase. The cost of that used to be paid at the other end: for up to
//! [`CEILING`] the job was write-only, and an operator watching one go the
//! wrong way at minute three had nothing to do but wait for it to finish.
//!
//! [`bridge`] is what makes it two-way. Claude Code has a second interface
//! besides its stdout, so a job on that harness gets a mailbox the operator can
//! drop a correction into, an optional gate in front of the handful of commands
//! that reach outside the repository, and two tools for reporting what it
//! produced. `pi` has no equivalent and gets none of it, which is a difference
//! between the harnesses rather than a gap: everything the bridge adds is an
//! improvement on a job that already worked without it, so every part of it
//! fails open on the existing adapters. Codex uses its native `turn/steer` and
//! approval callbacks instead of hooks. It verifies the requested approval
//! policy before starting a gated turn and acknowledges each correction.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! Any confinement. The process runs as the operator, in their repository, with
//! their credentials and their network, and it may commit, push and open pull
//! requests. That was asked for explicitly. Neither harness is asked to prompt
//! for permission on the ordinary path, because there is nobody there to
//! answer: `pi` has no permission system of its own and says so in its own
//! documentation, and Claude Code is started in the mode that does not ask. So
//! the boundary is the directory the operator chose and the fact that git can
//! undo what happens inside it. Nothing in this file should ever be described
//! as a sandbox.
//!
//! [`crate::domain::repository::Gate::AskBeforePushing`] does not change that
//! sentence and must not be read as changing it. It reads a shell line and decides
//! whether it looks like a push, which is a judgment about the ordinary case: a
//! job that wanted to get around it could, and it was already running as the
//! operator with their network before any of this. What it buys is that the
//! ordinary push, made by a job doing what it was asked, is one somebody gets
//! to see first.
