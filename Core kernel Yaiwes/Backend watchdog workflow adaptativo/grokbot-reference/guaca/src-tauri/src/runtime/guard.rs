//! Loop guard.
//!
//! Bidirectional agent messaging does not terminate on its own. Two agents
//! being polite at each other is an infinite loop that costs real money, and
//! a broadcast to N agents that each reply to the sender is a fan-in storm.
//! None of the protocols in the interoperability literature specify a
//! termination condition; they describe how to address a peer, not when to
//! stop. So Guac supplies one.
//!
//! Five independent limits, because each catches a different shape of runaway
//! and any one of them alone has a hole:
//!
//! | Limit             | Catches                                        |
//! |-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
//! | hop depth         | long delegation chains, A->B->C->D->...         |
//! | run step budget   | everything else, as a hard ceiling on spend     |
//! | per-pair sends    | two agents ping-ponging inside the hop budget   |
//! | content dedup     | an agent restating itself to make progress      |
//! | fan-out width     | one call blasting every agent in the directory  |
//!
//! Refusals are returned to the calling model as tool results, never silently
//! dropped. An agent that is told "you have already sent Chef 3 messages this
//! run" will stop. An agent whose message vanishes will retry.
