//! The menu bar presence.
//!
//! The second file that knows Tauri exists, and it earns that the same way
//! `app.rs` does: everything above it is a plain library. What the strip *says*
//! is decided in `menubar.rs`, which has no idea a platform menu exists and is
//! tested without one. This file draws that decision, and turns a click back
//! into something the runtime already knows how to do.
//!
//! Two things here are less obvious than they look.
//!
//! **The presence is read, not accumulated.** Every number on the strip but the
//! session total is a fresh read of whatever already holds the truth: the
//! roster, the activity map, the pending requests, the usage table. A presence
//! assembled by adding up events drifts the moment one is missed, and the thing
//! that would drift is the number the operator is using to decide whether to go
//! and look. The reads are local and happen at most every
//! [`COALESCE`], and only while something is happening.
//!
//! **A menu is edited in place when it can be.** Replacing the menu closes one
//! the operator is reading, and the spend on it moves every few seconds while a
//! crew works, so a strip that rebuilt on every change would be unreadable
//! exactly when it was worth reading. `menubar::plan` decides which of the two
//! a change is.
