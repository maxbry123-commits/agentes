//! The Claude backend, which is where an Anthropic subscription can be spent.
//!
//! Guaca speaks one shape of model API everywhere else: a list of messages in,
//! a stream of deltas and a set of tool calls out. This backend is not an
//! endpoint at all. It runs the `claude` program once per model call, writes the
//! conversation to its stdin and reads its stdout, so this file is a
//! translation in the same sense [`super::codex`] is, against a process rather
//! than a wire.
//!
//! ## Why a program and not a token
//!
//! Anthropic restricts a consumer OAuth token to the program it was issued to,
//! server-side. Guaca holding one and dialling the Messages API is refused; the
//! `claude` program on the same machine and the same account runs the work off
//! the plan. So the way to spend a subscription is to *be* the program, which is
//! the same fact [`crate::domain::repository::Harness`] is built on, one level
//! up: there it decides who writes code, here it decides who answers a turn.
//! `docs/PROTOCOL.md` has the dates and the sources.
//!
//! ## Guaca keeps its own loop
//!
//! This is the decision the rest of the file follows from, and it is the
//! opposite of the one [`crate::coding`] makes.
//!
//! `claude` is an agent harness: given tools it can reach, it runs its own
//! rounds and hands back a conclusion. Letting it do that here would move
//! `max_tool_rounds`, `reserve_step` and every stop check inside a program this
//! app does not control, and the guard would be enforced by a process boundary
//! instead of by `runtime/guard.rs`. A coding job can afford that because it is
//! a different unit of work with its own budget. A turn cannot: it is the unit
//! the five limits are written in.
//!
//! So the program is given no tools at all (`--tools ""`, no MCP servers) and
//! asked for one structured answer per call, through `--json-schema`. What comes
//! back is what this app's own tool call already looks like: something to say,
//! and a list of calls to make. Guaca dispatches them, exactly as it does for
//! the other two providers, and the round loop in `runtime/mod.rs` never learns
//! there was a third.
//!
//! The schema is built from the turn's own [`ToolSpec`]s as a discriminated
//! union, so the program validates a call against the tool's real parameters
//! before this app ever sees it. A malformed tool call is not unlikely here, it
//! is unrepresentable.
//!
//! ## The program is run with the operator's settings switched off
//!
//! Every isolation flag in [`argv`] is load-bearing, and the measurement is in
//! its doc comment. `claude` started the ordinary way loads the operator's own
//! MCP servers, hooks and settings, and an agent in this app would inherit all
//! of it: their connected Gmail, their Grafana, their `SessionStart` hooks, and
//! a hundred thousand tokens of tool definitions on every call. What the
//! operator configures *for Claude* that this app does want is the part they
//! cannot pass another way: the sign-in and the model.
//!
//! ## The program is started in an empty directory this app owns
//!
//! A child process inherits its parent's working directory, and a
//! double-clicked app's is `/`: `launchd` starts one there, which is the same
//! finding [`crate::programs`] is built on, from the other end. `claude` takes
//! the directory it is started in as the project it is working on and asks the
//! operating system what it may reach inside it. Started in `/` that question
//! covers every protected folder on the machine, and macOS answers a child's
//! request in the name of the *responsible* process rather than the child, so
//! the operator is asked whether **Guaca** may read their photos, their music
//! library, their Desktop and their Downloads, once per model call, about
//! folders this app has never read and has no tool that could.
//!
//! Measured on 2026-08-27 against 2.1.247: one turn produced
//! `kTCCServiceMediaLibrary`, `kTCCServicePhotos`,
//! `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDesktopFolder`,
//! `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDownloadsFolder` and a refused
//! `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`, each logged by `tccd` as
//! `responsible=com.madebywelch.guac, accessing=com.anthropic.claude-code`.
//! [`scratch`] is what takes the disk back out of that question. It is not
//! tidiness: a permission dialog naming this app for something it does not do
//! is one an operator either denies, and then distrusts the app, or accepts,
//! and then has granted a real reach to a program that asked under a borrowed
//! name.
//!
//! ## A refusal is not a failure of the program
//!
//! The model's own safety check can stop an answer on a call that succeeded,
//! and when it does the program has nothing to report but the model's account
//! of it. That arrives in the same place a spent plan does and has to be told
//! apart from one, because the two want opposite handling: a plan is over until
//! the operator does something, and a refusal ran on what the model was
//! writing, so the next draw is a different question. [`REFUSED`] is the field
//! that separates them and [`LlmError::ModelRefused`] is what the turn's three
//! attempts then apply to.
//!
//! ## What it does not report
//!
//! Money that moved. `total_cost_usd` on a plan is the equivalent API price
//! rather than a charge, which is the same claim [`crate::coding::Outcome`]
//! makes and no more. It is dropped rather than recorded, so the usage table
//! keeps meaning what it has always meant; the tokens are real and are counted.
