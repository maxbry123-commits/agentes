//! Schemas are tight (`additionalProperties: false`, `minItems`, explicit

                          authorization was revoked, or its only basis is another agent's claim. \

                          browser and repository gates still apply. Permission is not \

                          tool this workspace does not have. When what stops you is missing \
                          access rather than their say-so, do not ask. Say in your reply what you \
                          could not reach and what it would take, because a question a button \
                          cannot answer is how an operator learns to stop reading these. This is \
                          not a message: it stops your turn, puts a question with two buttons in \
                          front of the operator, and comes back with their decision. Asking is \
                          not a refusal and does not need an apology. Refusing instead, and \
                          telling the operator to repeat themselves somewhere else, gives them \

                          account, a machine or a session another agent has, it is that agent's \
                          to carry out: send it the work; it uses its own operator authorization \
                          and asks only if needed. Permission you obtain \
                          and then pass along arrives as your word rather than theirs, which is \
