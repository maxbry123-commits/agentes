#
# There is nothing to download. Latest means the tip of `main`, compiled on
# this machine, so this script is a fetch, a build and a swap.
#
# The swap is the part worth reading. It is two renames on one volume rather
# than a copy over the top: `cp -R` onto an existing bundle merges into it, and
# what survives is every file the previous build shipped and this one does not,
# inside an app that looks new. Staging the incoming copy beside the
# destination first means the app on disk is either the old one or the new one
# and never a mixture of both, and anything that goes wrong before the new one
# has been checked puts the old one back rather than leaving nothing.
#
# It quits a running instance first, and that is not politeness. Closing the
# window hides it and the menu bar keeps it alive, so "I closed it" is not the
# same as "it is not running", and replacing a bundle out from under a live
# process is how you get an app that dies partway through somebody's turn.
#
# It re-signs. Tauri leaves the linker's ad-hoc signature, which covers the
# executable and seals nothing else, so `codesign --verify` on the installed
# bundle answers a narrower question than the one being asked. Signing it as a
# bundle is what makes the check at the end mean something. Name a certificate
# in GUACA_SIGN_IDENTITY to sign with one instead.
#
# Nothing under ~/Library/Application Support/com.madebywelch.guac is touched.
# The workspace, the database, the sign-ins and the settings are the operator's,
# and reinstalling is not resetting.
#
# This builds; it does not verify. ./scripts/ci.sh is the gate.
