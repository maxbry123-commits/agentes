<strong>AI agents forget everything between sessions. GrayMatter gives them persistent memory, a self-building knowledge graph, and cuts context tokens by 90%.</strong>
<br /><br />
One binary. Drop it in. Run it. No Docker, no databases, no config files, no cloud accounts, no bullshit.
<br /><br />
<strong>General-purpose MCP server. Zero vendor lock-in.</strong>
<br />
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity — and any MCP-compatible client.
<br />
Also a plain Go library if you don't use MCP.
<br /><br />
Free. Offline. No account required.

<br />
</div>

## Why

Every AI agent is **stateless by default**. Each run re-injects the full conversation history — and that history grows linearly. Two prompts in and you've already burned half of your daily quota.

That's not just a memory problem. That's a money and performance problem.

**Mem0, Zep, Supermemory** solve this — but they're Python/TypeScript-only and require a running server. The Go ecosystem has no production-ready, embeddable, zero-dependency memory layer for agents.

That gap is GrayMatter.

  <img src=".github/assets/token-reduction.png" alt="Context tokens per query vs full-history injection" width="800px" style="max-width: 900px;">
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>~90% reduction in context tokens</strong> — versus full-history injection.<br>
Remembers what a sliding window forgets: facts planted 96 sessions back come back <strong>83%</strong> of the time.<br>
Context quality <em>improves</em> over time as consolidation surfaces only what matters.<br>
No Docker. No Redis. No API key required for storage.<br><br>
Drop it in once. It auto-connects to <strong>Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity</strong> — any MCP-compatible client picks it up automatically.
</p>

---

## Knowledge Graph

Your agent doesn't just remember facts — it builds a map of how they connect.

Run the daemon with `--kg` and every consolidation cycle extracts typed
entities (person, organization, project) and links the ones that appear
together. No manual tagging. No configuration. The graph builds itself from
ordinary use.

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/kg-graph-view.png" alt="Knowledge Graph in Obsidian" width="800px" style="max-width: 900px;">
</p>

<p align="center">
Every edge carries <strong>receipts</strong>: the fact IDs that produced it.<br>
Export to <strong>Obsidian</strong> with one command — entities become notes,<br>
connections become wikilinks, and the whole graph renders natively.
</p>

```bash
graymatter daemon run --kg    # that's it — the graph builds itself
```

The graph as one self-contained page — inline force-directed SVG, zero
external assets, works offline. Hover any edge to see the fact IDs that
produced it:

```bash
graymatter kg render --out graph.html
graymatter kg render --out graph.dot    # Graphviz, for your own layout
graymatter doctor --graph --html        # analytics + this render in one go
```

Watch it build, one frame per session:

```bash
scripts/kg-timelapse.sh    # deterministic corpus -> frames -> GIF
                           # or anywhere: scripts/Dockerfile.kg-timelapse
```

---

## Observability

You can't improve what you can't see.

`graymatter tui` opens a live terminal dashboard with everything your
agent memory is doing — no extra setup required.

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/tui-tour.gif" alt="GrayMatter-TUI" width="900px" style="max-width: 900px;">
</p>

**What you get at a glance:**

- **Facts** — total stored, distributed across agents
- **Memory cost** — KB on disk (text + embeddings), not tokens
- **Recalls** — cumulative access count across all sessions
- **Health** — percentage of facts above relevance threshold (weight > 0.5)
- **Token cost (30d)** — real spend breakdown by model, with cache hit rate
- **Agent activity** — facts vs recalls per agent, side by side
- **Weight distribution** — how consolidated your memory is over time
- **Activity timeline** — facts created per day, last 30 days

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds. Press `1–4` to switch tabs,
`r` to force refresh, `q` to quit.

`graymatter doctor --graph` extends visibility to the knowledge graph itself:
hubs by degree, articulation points, orphans, and a declared connectivity
ratio — printed or emitted as JSON.

## What GrayMatter gives you

| | |
|---|---|
| **Persistent memory** | Facts survive across sessions. Recall by meaning, not just keyword |
| **90% token reduction** | Top-8 relevant facts instead of full-history injection |
| **Automatic hooks** | Claude Code injects routine recall every turn; MCP remains available for writes and focused searches (`graymatter hooks install`) |
| **Receipts, not vibes** | `recall --explain` returns why each fact ranked: per-signal ranks, fused score, provenance |
| **Knowledge graph** | Typed entities and co-mention edges, auto-populated from ordinary use |
| **Self-curation** | `memory_reflect` lets the agent add, update, forget, and link its own memories |
| **Context block** | Projects top facts into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md inside a token budget (`context-sync`) |
| **Free auditor** | `doctor --audit` measures tokens, duplicates, staleness, and marker conflicts in any instruction file |
| **Deterministic decay** | 30-day half-life; facts fade when nothing touches them. Tombstones, never deletes |
| **Single binary** | ~10 MB static. No Docker, no Redis, no config files, no cloud accounts |

---

## Quick start

Install and see it working in under a minute — no API keys, no Ollama:

```bash
go install github.com/angelnicolasc/graymatter/cmd/graymatter@latest
graymatter demo              # a working store with 3 agents, then the TUI opens
graymatter init              # wire YOUR project: MCP config + memory block
graymatter init --hooks      # Claude Code: memory injected every turn
graymatter doctor            # verify everything
```

`graymatter init --global` still performs that normal setup in the current
directory. It additionally installs the managed memory instructions in Claude
Code and OpenCode's home-scoped instruction files. It does **not** globalize
project-scoped MCP configs: each repository must be wired separately with
`graymatter init` or manual client configuration. Codex is the exception in
the table below because its MCP config is already home-scoped.

`graymatter demo` seeds a scratch store, runs consolidation, and opens the
TUI — then `graymatter kg render --out kg-graph.html` shows the graph it
built. Restart your editor. Seven memory tools are live.

<summary><strong>MCP client wiring</strong> — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, and anything else</summary>

`graymatter init` auto-wires every supported client at once. Existing entries
from other MCP servers are merged, never overwritten.

| Client | Config file | Scope |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` | project |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | project |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `~/.codex/config.toml` | home |
| OpenCode | `opencode.jsonc` | project |
| Antigravity (Google) | `mcp_config.json` | opt-in |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/mcp.json` | project |
| VS Code Copilot Agent | `.vscode/mcp.json` | project |

**Also works out of the box:** Pi (reads `.mcp.json` natively), Zed, Cline,
and any MCP-compatible client — point them at `graymatter mcp serve`.
Per-client verified configs for 25 clients, including the ones that need a
different shape (VS Code's `servers` key, Codex TOML, Zed's
`context_servers`), live in [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).
See [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for tool parameters and query patterns.

## Token efficiency

Numbers produced by `go run ./benchmarks/token_count` — real Recall calls,
keyword embedder, no LLM required:

| Sessions | Full injection | GrayMatter | Reduction |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 1        | ~80 tokens    | ~80 tokens | 0% |
| 10       | ~630 tokens   | ~550 tokens | 12% |
| 30       | ~1,880 tokens | ~550 tokens | 71% |
| 100      | ~6,960 tokens | ~670 tokens | **90%** |

### Does it return the *right* facts?

Tokens are only half the question. A second benchmark checks whether the
returned facts actually answer the query, against a real sliding window:

| | sliding window | GrayMatter | + `MinRelevance` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Finds a fact planted 96 sessions ago | 0% | **83%** | 83% |
| Returns a superseded fact | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Tokens per query | 95 | 114 | **64** |

At equal fact count, relevance-selected facts cost slightly more tokens than a
window's newest-first picks. With `MinRelevance`, GrayMatter drops below the
window's cost while keeping full recall of old facts. Method and per-query
detail in [`benchmarks/RESULTS.md`](benchmarks/RESULTS.md).

Every figure on this page is machine-checked against a live run in CI.

---

## Memory lifecycle

```
Recall(agent, task)          ← hybrid: vector + keyword + recency → top-8 facts
    ↓
Inject into system prompt    ← your 3 lines of code
    ↓
Agent runs
    ↓
Remember(agent, observation) ← store key facts during/after run
    ↓
Consolidate() [async]        ← summarise + decay + prune + extract entities
```

Consolidation is the only "smart" step. Everything else is deterministic.

### Hooks (Claude Code, opt-in)

`graymatter hooks install` writes the hook block into `.claude/settings.json`
and after that the hook runner supplies routine recall automatically:

| Hook | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `SessionStart` | Injects the freshest live facts plus project-wide `__shared__` conventions — and re-injects after `/compact` (your memory survives compaction) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Short per-turn recall (top-3 agent + top-3 shared), suppressed when identical to the previous turn; `remember: <text>` in a prompt is an instant deterministic save, `remember shared: <text>` saves into the shared namespace every agent reads |
| `PreCompact` | Deterministic checkpoint before context compaction |
| `SessionEnd` | Checkpoint + detached consolidation (survives the editor closing) |

Hooks and MCP are complementary. Every non-empty hook recall begins with a
bracketed `GrayMatter hook recall ran` marker naming the namespace it actually
queried. This page never spells that marker out in full, so an agent reading
the docs cannot mistake them for a live recall. The agent reuses
only the newest block available for the session's initial turn. If that ID
matches its own, each non-empty section replaces that scope's startup search.
If the IDs differ, it reruns both project and `__shared__` searches because
cross-namespace deduplication may have placed a shared fact in the project
section. Missing sections also fall back to MCP. Focused and batch searches,
writes, corrections, aliases, and checkpoint tools always remain available.

Failure contract: every error exits 0 with empty stdout and a receipt in
`<dataDir>/hooks.log` — a broken memory degrades silently, it never breaks
the session. `graymatter hooks doctor` verifies registration, the recorded
binary path, and store latency; the hot path is machine-checked in
[`benchmarks/hook_latency`](benchmarks/hook_latency) with hardware-relative
gates — the recall's marginal cost against the same machine's checkpoint
baseline (≤ 200 ms) and in-process scaling (≤ 2.5× of linear at 10k facts) —
because absolute wall-clock numbers on shared CI runners measure the runner
queue, not the code. Reference-hardware figure: p99 121 ms user-prompt on a
10k-fact store, no LLM, localhost only by construction.

### Context block (opt-in)

`graymatter context-sync` projects the highest-weight live facts into a managed
block inside CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md, inside an explicit token budget.

Safety properties:

- Content outside the markers is never touched.
- Every rewrite leaves the previous file as `<file>.bak`.
- Hand edits are detected and warned about before overwrite — never silent.
- Deterministic projection: same store state, same block bytes.

Tradeoffs written down rather than left as folklore. Each ADR includes the
condition under which it should be reversed.

## Storage

| Layer | Tech | What it holds |
|-------|------|--------------|
| KV store | bbolt (pure Go, ACID) | Facts, sessions, checkpoints, metadata, KG |
| Vector index | chromem-go (pure Go) | Semantic embeddings, hybrid retrieval |
| Export | Markdown files | Human-readable, git-friendly, Obsidian-compatible |

Single file: `.graymatter/gray.db`. No migrations. Append-only with decay-based eviction.

---

## Embeddings

GrayMatter degrades gracefully across four modes, always finding a way to work:

| Mode | When |
|------|------|
| Ollama | Local model available |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` set |
| Voyage AI | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` set — Anthropic's recommended embeddings partner (voyage-3, 1024 dims) |
| Keyword-only | Nothing available — TF-IDF + recency, zero deps |

## What GrayMatter is NOT

Not tied to any vendor. Not a framework. Not a hosted service. Not a knowledge-base UI. Not trying to win the enterprise memory market.

It is exactly one thing: **the missing stateful layer for Go agents**, packaged as an MCP server and a library you import in three lines.

---

## How it compares

**Code graphs** parse your source tree and expose symbols, call edges, and blast radius. The repo is the source of truth. GrayMatter never reads your source — facts exist only because something deliberately wrote them, and they carry a 30-day half-life that code graphs must never have, since a stale fact means something changed and a stale code graph means nothing did.

**Context compressors** shrink payloads already moving through the transport. GrayMatter never sees your traffic — the agent writes one distilled sentence and recalls a handful later. Some compressors ship session memory; the difference is scope. They stack.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Ollama-backed consolidation LLM — shipped in [v0.14.0](CHANGELOG.md): propose/apply with tombstone receipts, fully local ([ADR-011](docs/decisions/011-consolidation-propose-apply.md))
- [ ] Cross-project memory federation (read-only) — [#12](https://github.com/angelnicolasc/graymatter/issues/12), deferred until a multi-project store demonstrates the need
- [ ] WebSocket streaming for REST API
- [ ] MCP 2026-07-28 stateless protocol support
