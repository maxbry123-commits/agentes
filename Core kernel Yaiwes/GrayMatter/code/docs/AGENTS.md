# AGENTS.md — GrayMatter Memory Guide for AI Agents

> Operational guide for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity, custom MCP clients, Go callers) using GrayMatter as long-term memory.

## Philosophy

GrayMatter is your long-term memory. Unlike conversation context, which disappears at the end of a session, GrayMatter facts persist across sessions, projects, and agent restarts. Use it to accumulate knowledge that makes you more effective over time.

**Key principle**: Store *conclusions*, not *conversations*. A good memory is something you would want injected into your system prompt on day 1 of a new session.

---

## MCP Tool Reference

Seven tools are registered by `graymatter mcp serve` (see [`cmd/graymatter/internal/mcp/server.go`](../cmd/graymatter/internal/mcp/server.go)). **Parameter names are not uniform** — check the table before calling.

| Tool | Required params | Optional params | Returns |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| `memory_search` | `agent_id` (string), `query` (string) | `top_k` (int, default `8`), `explain` (boolean, default `false`) | Numbered fact list with a count header (deduped), or a "No memories found" notice |
| `memory_search_batch` | `agent_id` (string), `queries` (string array) | `top_k` (int, default `8`) | Merged deduped block plus per-query lists |
| `memory_add` | `agent_id` (string), `text` (string) | — | Confirmation string |
| `memory_alias` | `agent_id` (string), `term` (string), `equivalents` (string array) | — | Confirmation naming the term and its equivalents |
| `checkpoint_save` | `agent_id` (string) | `state` (JSON-encoded string) | Confirmation containing the checkpoint ID |
| `checkpoint_resume` | `agent_id` (string) | — | `Checkpoint "id" restored` + `Created:` (RFC3339) + indented `State:` JSON; error result when none exists |
| `memory_reflect` | `action` (`add`\|`update`\|`forget`\|`link`\|`pin`\|`unpin`), plus at least one of **`agent_id`** (canonical) or `agent` (deprecated alias; `agent_id` wins when both are set) | `text` (string), `target` (string — old fact text for `update`/`forget`/`pin`/`unpin`; target node ID for `link`) | Confirmation string |

> ℹ️ **`memory_reflect` accepts both `agent_id` (canonical) and `agent` (deprecated alias).** Since the canonical flip ([ADR-014](decisions/014-agent-id-canonical.md)) at least one of the two is required — the schema enforces it as an `anyOf` allowing both — and `agent_id` wins when both are set. New integrations spell it `agent_id`, matching every other tool.

### Hooks and MCP at session start

Claude Code hooks and MCP are complementary. When a hook actually injects
recalled facts, the block begins with a bracketed marker that names the
hook's real `agent_id`.

Before the first substantive reply, inspect only the newest hook block
available for the session's initial turn; quoted examples and blocks from older
turns do not count. Reuse its non-empty sections only when the marker's id
equals the `agent_id` you intended to search. If the ids differ, run both
project and `__shared__` searches: cross-namespace deduplication may have
placed a shared duplicate under `## Memory`. With matching ids, run only the
search for each missing section. Continue to use MCP for
`checkpoint_resume`, focused or batch lookups, writes, corrections, aliases,
and checkpoint saves. An empty, failed, absent, or throttled hook emits no
fresh block, so ordinary MCP startup searches remain the fallback.

### Return-shape examples

Every success result carries **both** a `structuredContent` object (declared in the tool's `outputSchema`) and the same human-readable text in `content` — machine-readable and text-parsing clients are both first-class ([ADR-013](decisions/013-structured-tool-results.md)).

```jsonc
// memory_search — content (text)
"Found 3 relevant memories for agent \"frontend-agent\":\n\n1. User prefers TypeScript with strict mode\n2. Project uses pnpm, not npm\n3. Auth tokens live in HttpOnly cookies"

// memory_search — structuredContent
{ "agent_id": "frontend-agent", "query": "css tooling", "count": 3, "facts": ["User prefers TypeScript with strict mode", "Project uses pnpm, not npm", "Auth tokens live in HttpOnly cookies"] }
// empty state: count 0, facts [] — plus the "No memories found ..." notice as text

// memory_add — structuredContent
{ "agent_id": "frontend-agent", "stored": true }

// checkpoint_save — structuredContent
{ "agent_id": "migration-agent", "checkpoint_id": "01JZK7...", "created_at": "2026-04-28T13:42:11Z" }

// checkpoint_resume — content (text)
"Checkpoint \"01JZK7...\" restored for agent \"migration-agent\".\nCreated: 2026-04-28T13:42:11Z\nState:\n{\n  \"task\": \"db migration\",\n  \"step\": 3\n}\n"

// checkpoint_resume — structuredContent (state/message_count omitted when empty)
{ "id": "01JZK7...", "created_at": "2026-04-28T13:42:11Z", "state": { "task": "db migration", "step": 3 } }

// checkpoint_resume with no checkpoint — isError=true, text content only:
"no checkpoint found for agent \"migration-agent\": no checkpoints for agent \"migration-agent\""
// (content keeps the historical "no checkpoint found for agent ..." prose)

// memory_reflect — structuredContent
{ "action": "update", "agent": "backend-agent", "ok": true }
```

## When to Use Memory

### ALWAYS store

- **User preferences** — coding style, communication preferences, tool choices
- **Project conventions** — "this repo uses tabs not spaces", "never use X library"
- **Architecture decisions** — "chose PostgreSQL over MySQL because…"
- **Bug fixes & workarounds** — "fixed by upgrading to v2.3, don't downgrade"
- **Recurring patterns** — "user always asks for TypeScript examples first"
- **Environment quirks** — "needs `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`"
- **Stakeholder info** — "CTO prefers detailed explanations, CEO wants summaries"

### NEVER store

- **Conversation logs** — raw back-and-forth without conclusions
- **Duplicate information** — already in README, AGENTS.md, or code comments
- **Speculative thoughts** — "maybe we should try X" (store after the decision)
- **Secrets or credentials** — use proper secret management
- **Large outputs** — store the insight, not the 500-line stack trace

(Transient session state goes in a checkpoint, not a memory — see Anti-Pattern §5.)

### Decision Framework

```
About to store something?
├── Is it a conclusion / fact / preference?     → YES, store it
├── Is it raw conversation without insight?     → NO, extract insight first
├── Is it already documented in code/README?    → NO, reference docs instead
├── Will this still matter in 10 sessions?      → YES, store it
├── Is it temporary debugging state?            → NO, use checkpoint
└── Is it a secret / credential?                → NO, never store in memory
```

## Memory Operations

### `memory_add` — store a clean fact

Use when you have a single, atomic, well-formed fact.

**Good:**
```jsonc
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": {
    "agent_id": "frontend-agent",
    "text":     "User prefers Tailwind CSS over styled-components"
}}

{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": {
    "agent_id": "backend-agent",
    "text":     "API rate limit: 100 req/min — exceeded returns 429 with Retry-After header"
}}
```

**Bad:**
```jsonc
// Too vague
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "user likes things" }

// Conversation log
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "User: Can you help? Agent: Sure, what do you need?" }

// Duplicate (already in README)
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "Project uses React" }
```

### `memory_search` — retrieve relevant context

Always search before acting on ambiguous requests. Phrase the query as the *task you're trying to do*, not as keywords.

**Good queries:**
```jsonc
{ "agent_id": "frontend-agent",
  "query":    "how should I style this component",
  "top_k":    5 }

{ "agent_id": "backend-agent",
  "query":    "authentication middleware patterns for this project",
  "top_k":    8 }
```

**How retrieval works**

GrayMatter ranks facts via **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** over three independent signals (see [`pkg/memory/recall.go:14`](../pkg/memory/recall.go)):

1. **Vector similarity** (cosine, pluggable `VectorStore`) — when embeddings are available
2. **Keyword relevance** (TF-IDF approximation over bbolt facts)
3. **Recency** (exponential decay from `CreatedAt`)

Each signal produces an independent ranking; RRF fuses the ranks (not the scores) into a single ordered list. Returns top-K, deduplicated by text. Access metadata is updated asynchronously (`AccessCount++`, `AccessedAt = now`).

Facts marked superseded are dropped before any of this — a fact an agent has corrected or forgotten never competes for a slot. Graph neighbours of the top hit would also be appended, but nothing wires the graph into the store in shipped builds, so in practice that step never runs ([ADR-003](decisions/003-knowledge-graph-autopopulation.md)).

> RRF means **rank position matters, not raw scores** — a fact's contribution
> depends on where it placed in each ranking, not on how close the numbers
> were. As an agent you have no per-call control over this: there is no
> weighting parameter on `memory_search`.
>
> A Go caller configuring the store does. `StoreConfig.SignalWeights` sets how
> much each signal contributes (default vector 1.0, keyword 1.0, recency 0.5)
> and `MinRelevance` drops results below a fraction of the best score in the
> same result set. Both default to the behaviour described here. See
> [ADR-006](decisions/006-configurable-signal-weights.md).

**Query strategies:**

```jsonc
// Strategy 1: Broad context gathering at session start
{ "agent_id": "agent", "query": "<current task description>", "top_k": 8 }

// Strategy 2: Focused lookup mid-task
{ "agent_id": "agent", "query": "<specific question>", "top_k": 3 }

// Strategy 3: Several open questions at once — one batch call
{ "agent_id": "agent", "queries": ["<question 1>", "<question 2>", "<question 3>"], "top_k": 3 }
```

### `memory_reflect` — self-curation

The most powerful tool. Use it to maintain memory quality over time.

> Parameter is **`agent_id`** (canonical, since ADR-014). `agent` remains accepted as a deprecated alias - the schema expresses this as an `anyOf` requiring at least one of the two (both allowed) - and `agent_id` wins when both are set. New integrations spell it `agent_id`.

| Action | Param meaning of `text` | Param meaning of `target` |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| `add` | The new fact (required) | (unused) |
| `update` | The corrected fact (required) | The old fact text to supersede (required) |
| `forget` | The fact to remove (alternative to `target`) | The fact to remove (wins when both are set) |
| `link` | Source node ID (required) | Target node ID in the knowledge graph (required) |
| `pin` | The fact to pin (alternative to `target`) | The fact to pin (wins when both are set) |
| `unpin` | The fact to unpin (alternative to `target`) | The fact to unpin (wins when both are set) |

**Pin/unpin:** a pinned fact is exempt from decay, pruning and summarisation
(ADR-010) — use it when the user declares something permanent: a standing
obligation, an architecture decision, a security policy. Pins are visible
(star in the TUI, counted by `status`, flagged in exports). Unpinning
restores normal decay; a fact pinned for a long time inherits the accumulated
staleness when unpinned, which is honest rather than silently reset.

**Update workflow:**
```jsonc
// 1. Find the old fact
{ "tool": "memory_search", "args": {
    "agent_id": "backend-agent", "query": "API base URL", "top_k": 3
}}

// 2. Supersede it
{ "tool": "memory_reflect", "args": {
    "action": "update",
    "agent_id":  "backend-agent",
    "text":   "API base URL is https://api.v2.example.com",
    "target": "API base URL is https://api.v1.example.com"
}}
```

The old fact is tombstoned and stops being recalled from the very next search
— not on the next consolidation pass, and not eventually. It is not deleted:
it stays visible to `graymatter export`, the TUI and any `List` call, with its
`superseded_by` pointing at the fact that replaced it, so the correction can be
audited later. Ordinary decay and pruning collect it in due course.

> Before v0.10.0 this action set the old fact's weight to 0 and reported
> success, and recall does not read weight — so the superseded fact kept
> coming back alongside its own correction. If you are running an older
> binary, `update` does not do what this page says.

**Forget workflow:**
```jsonc
// Pass the fact in text — or in target; both are accepted.
// If both are set, target wins.
{ "tool": "memory_reflect", "args": {
    "action": "forget",
    "agent_id":  "backend-agent",
    "text":   "Workaround for Node 14 bug (project now on Node 18)"
}}
```

**Link workflow (knowledge graph):**

> ⚠️ `link` writes to the knowledge graph, and it does work in shipped builds:
> both the daemon and the `--no-daemon` direct store open a real graph and
> serve the write. It can still fail if the graph cannot be opened, in which
> case the tool returns `knowledge graph not available`. Call `link`
> opportunistically and degrade gracefully — never make it a hard
> prerequisite for a workflow.
>
> What does *not* happen is automatic population: nothing extracts entities
> from stored facts on its own, so the graph contains exactly what agents put
> in it by calling `link`. See
> [ADR-003](decisions/003-knowledge-graph-autopopulation.md).

```jsonc
{ "tool": "memory_reflect", "args": {
    "action": "link",
    "agent_id":  "backend-agent",
    "text":   "depends_on",
    "target":  "user-database"
}}
```

### `checkpoint_save` / `checkpoint_resume` — session continuity

Use for long-running tasks that might span multiple sessions or be interrupted.

**What checkpoints capture:**
- A JSON object (string-encoded at the MCP layer) — validated on save, rejected otherwise
- An ID + RFC3339 timestamp

**What they DON'T capture:**
- Memory facts (separate system — use `memory_add`)
- Filesystem state
- External-service state

**Pattern: task-progress tracking**
```jsonc
// Before starting
{ "tool": "checkpoint_save", "args": {
    "agent_id": "migration-agent",
    "state":    "{\"task\":\"db migration\",\"step\":0,\"tables_done\":[]}"
}}

// After each step
{ "tool": "checkpoint_save", "args": {
    "agent_id": "migration-agent",
    "state":    "{\"task\":\"db migration\",\"step\":3,\"tables_done\":[\"users\",\"orders\"]}"
}}

// On session start
{ "tool": "checkpoint_resume", "args": { "agent_id": "migration-agent" } }
// → parse the returned `state` JSON, continue from step
```

`state` is a **string** at the MCP layer — encode/decode JSON yourself. The CLI (`graymatter checkpoint resume`) does the same.

## Memory Hygiene

### Fact-quality checklist

Before storing, verify the fact:

- [ ] **Atomic** — one idea per fact, not a paragraph
- [ ] **Timeless** — still true in 3 months
- [ ] **Actionable** — helps future-you make better decisions
- [ ] **Specific** — "prefers tabs", not "has preferences"
- [ ] **Self-contained** — readable without conversation context

### Decay & consolidation

Facts decay. A fact you never recall will eventually be pruned.

**Mechanics** (defaults from [`config.go`](../config.go)):
- Initial weight = `1.0`
- Exponential decay based on time since last access
- Half-life = `30 days` (`DecayHalfLife = 720h`)
- Pruned when weight `< 0.01`
- Recall resets the decay clock for that fact
- Consolidation triggers when an agent has ≥ `ConsolidateThreshold` (default `20`) facts; runs async unless `AsyncConsolidate = false`; up to `MaxAsyncConsolidations` (default `2`) goroutines concurrently

**Implications:**
```jsonc
// Anti-pattern: store once, never reference → pruned after ~199 days
// (6.64 half-lives to fall below the 0.01 floor, at the default 30-day half-life)
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": { "agent_id": "agent", "text": "Critical security policy: …" }}
// Then never search for it.

	// Better: keep important facts warm by including them in routine context-gathering.

	// Best: the user declared it permanent (standing obligation, architecture
	// decision)? Pin it — memory_reflect action=pin exempts it from decay,
	// pruning and summarisation entirely (ADR-010).
	// ```
	// { "tool": "memory_reflect", "args": { "action": "pin", "agent_id": "agent",
	//     "text": "Critical security policy: …" }}
	// ```
	// A pinned fact never decays and is never pruned or summarised away;
	// unpin only restores normal decay — it does not retire the fact. A fact
	// that is wrong or superseded is fixed with memory_reflect update (or
	// forget); unpin is for a fact that is still true but no longer needs
	// permanence.
```

### Cleanup schedule

Every 10–20 sessions, sweep:

```bash
# 1. List everything for an agent
graymatter recall <agent_id> "*" --all

# 2. Identify low-quality entries (vague, outdated, duplicate)
# 3. Clean up via memory_reflect (forget / update)
```

---

## Shared Memory (`__shared__`)

GrayMatter reserves the agent ID `__shared__` (the constant `SharedAgentID` in [`pkg/memory/store.go:40`](../pkg/memory/store.go)) for facts every agent in this workspace should see — project conventions, team rules, security policies.

There is **no magic routing** at the MCP layer. To write or read shared memory, just pass `__shared__` as the `agent_id` parameter exactly like any other agent ID:

```jsonc
// Write a project-wide rule
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": {
    "agent_id": "__shared__",
    "text":     "Project convention: all timestamps stored as UTC ISO-8601 strings"
}}

// Read it
{ "tool": "memory_search", "args": {
    "agent_id": "__shared__",
    "query":    "timestamp conventions",
    "top_k":    5
}}
```

**Per-agent + shared in one shot**: issue two calls (one with the agent's own ID, one with `__shared__`) and merge the results. The Go library exposes a `RecallAll(agentID, query)` helper that does this for you ([`graymatter.go`](../graymatter.go)) — there is no MCP equivalent.

**Shared-memory best practices:**
- Store **project-wide** conventions, not agent-specific preferences
- Prefix shared facts with intent: `"Project convention: …"`, `"Team rule: …"`, `"Security policy: …"`
- Keep it small and high-signal (≲ 50 facts)
- The CLI `--shared` flag on `graymatter remember` / `graymatter recall` writes/reads this namespace directly

---

## Session Continuity Patterns

### Pattern 1: memory-first boot

```jsonc
// 1. Was I interrupted?
{ "tool": "checkpoint_resume", "args": { "agent_id": "my-agent" } }

// 2. Pull relevant memories for the current task
{ "tool": "memory_search", "args": {
    "agent_id": "my-agent",
    "query":    "<current task description>",
    "top_k":    8
}}

// 3. Pull shared context
{ "tool": "memory_search", "args": {
    "agent_id": "__shared__",
    "query":    "<current task description>",
    "top_k":    5
}}

// 4. Concatenate into the system prompt and proceed.
```

### Pattern 2: continuous learning

After significant interactions, extract atomic conclusions and `memory_add` them. Don't store the conversation; store what you *learned*.

### Pattern 3: multi-agent coordination

```jsonc
// Agent-A discovers a convention
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": { "agent_id": "agent-a",
    "text": "Use async/await, not callbacks" }}

// Promote it to shared so Agent-B sees it on their next recall
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": { "agent_id": "__shared__",
    "text": "Project convention: use async/await, not callbacks" }}

// Agent-B picks it up via shared search
{ "tool": "memory_search", "args": {
    "agent_id": "__shared__",
    "query":    "async patterns" }}
```

## CLI Parity

Every memory operation is also available from the terminal — useful for scripts, CI hooks, and debugging.

| MCP tool | CLI equivalent |
|----------|----------------|
| `memory_add` | `graymatter remember <agent_id> "<text>"` (or `--shared` for `__shared__`) |
| `memory_search` | `graymatter recall <agent_id> "<query>"` (`--all` to dump every fact, `--shared` to query `__shared__`) |
| `checkpoint_save` | (library/MCP only — no CLI) |
| `checkpoint_resume` | `graymatter checkpoint resume <agent_id>` (lists most recent) |
| — | `graymatter checkpoint list <agent_id>` (history) |
| `memory_reflect` | (MCP only — no CLI) |

Other useful subcommands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `graymatter init` | Wire MCP into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity (see [README.md](../README.md)); `--kg` persists graph auto-population, `--hooks` installs Claude Code memory hooks |
| `graymatter demo` | Seed a scratch multi-agent store, run consolidation, open the TUI — one command, no keys |
| `graymatter hooks install` / `uninstall` / `doctor` | Manage Claude Code automatic memory hooks (per-turn injection of agent facts + `__shared__` conventions, `remember:` / `remember shared:` instant-save, /compact survival); every hook failure degrades silently |
| `graymatter recall <agent> "<query>" --explain` | Receipts per fact: per-signal RRF ranks, fused score, weight, age, provenance (`fact_id`, `written_at`) — same JSON shape as the MCP `explain` payload |
| `graymatter consolidate <agent_id>` | Run one consolidation cycle through the daemon's policy |
| `graymatter kg render --out graph.html` | Self-contained force-graph page (offline, tooltips carry fact-ID receipts); `--out graph.dot` for Graphviz |
| `graymatter mcp serve` | Start the MCP server (stdio default, `--http 127.0.0.1:8080` for HTTP; the HTTP transport requires a bearer token) |
| `graymatter tui` | 4-view terminal dashboard (live observability) |
| `graymatter export --format obsidian --out vault/` | Dump all memories to a Markdown vault |
| `graymatter run <skill.md>` | Execute a SKILL.md agent file |
| `graymatter sessions list` | List managed agent sessions |
| `graymatter plugin {install,list,remove}` | Manage local plugins |

---

## Library API (Go callers)

If you're embedding GrayMatter directly in a Go program (not via MCP), see [`examples/agent/main.go`](../examples/agent/main.go) for the canonical pattern:

1. `graymatter.Open(graymatter.DefaultConfig())` — open the store
2. `mem.Recall(ctx, agentID, query, topK)` — pull context before the LLM call
3. Inject the recalled facts into the system prompt
4. After the LLM responds, `mem.Remember(ctx, agentID, conclusion)` (or `RememberExtracted` to let GrayMatter pull atomic facts via Anthropic Haiku)
5. `defer mem.Close()` to flush + release the bbolt lock

For the public API surface and stability promises, see [`docs/api-stability.md`](api-stability.md).

---

## Multi-Process Gotcha (bbolt write lock)

GrayMatter persists to bbolt, a single-writer embedded DB. **Only one process may hold the write lock at a time.** This shows up the moment you run two MCP-aware agents in the same workspace (e.g. Claude Code + OpenCode + the `graymatter tui` dashboard).

What happens in v0.5.x:

- The `graymatter` CLI and TUI auto-detect a held lock and **fall back to read-only mode**. You can still recall, but `remember` / `checkpoint save` will refuse with a clear error rather than block forever.
- MCP servers spawned by separate clients will fight over the lock. The **second one to start fails fast**, not silently.
- Workarounds:
  - Run a single shared `graymatter mcp serve --http 127.0.0.1:8080` and point all clients at it (most robust). The HTTP transport requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the token lives in `<data-dir>/graymatter.http-token`
  - Quit one agent's MCP integration before working from the other
  - Use the `tui` in `--read-only` mode explicitly when you only want to inspect

If you're an agent and `memory_add` returns a lock error, **degrade gracefully**: keep the fact in your in-context working memory, surface the error to the user, suggest closing competing processes — don't retry in a loop.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Dumping Ground

```jsonc
// BAD
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "User said hello" }
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "User asked about weather" }
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "I responded with the forecast" }
// → 1000 low-signal facts, important ones buried

// GOOD
{ "agent_id": "agent",
  "text":     "User is planning outdoor event, needs weather updates" }
```

### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

```jsonc
// BAD: never updating
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "User likes X" }
// User changes preference; you keep recalling and acting on the stale fact.

// GOOD: update on change
{ "tool": "memory_reflect", "args": {
    "action": "update",
    "agent_id": "agent",
    "text":   "User now prefers Y (changed from X)",
    "target": "User likes X" }}
```

### 3. The Orphaned Fact

```jsonc
// BAD: no context
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "Blue" }

// GOOD: contextual
{ "agent_id": "agent", "text": "User's preferred UI theme: blue" }
```

### 4. The Over-Specific Fact

```jsonc
// BAD: rotting timestamp & location
{ "agent_id": "agent",
  "text":     "On 2026-04-15 at 3:42pm, fixed bug in line 47 of auth.js" }

// GOOD: generalised learning
{ "agent_id": "agent",
  "text":     "auth.js: JWT validation fails when clock skew > 5 minutes" }
```

### 5. The Memory Leak (transient state as a fact)

```jsonc
// BAD
{ "tool": "memory_add", "args": {
    "agent_id": "agent",
    "text":     "Current file being edited: src/components/Button.tsx" }}

// GOOD: that's checkpoint territory
{ "tool": "checkpoint_save", "args": {
    "agent_id": "agent",
    "state":    "{\"current_file\":\"src/components/Button.tsx\"}" }}
```

### 6. Ignoring Shared Memory

```jsonc
// BAD: every agent stores the same convention
{ "agent_id": "agent-a", "text": "Use TypeScript" }
{ "agent_id": "agent-b", "text": "Use TypeScript" }
{ "agent_id": "agent-c", "text": "Use TypeScript" }

// GOOD: write once, all agents see it
{ "agent_id": "__shared__",
  "text":     "Project convention: use TypeScript" }
```

### 7. Treating `link` as Mandatory

`memory_reflect` `link` only works when the host has wired a knowledge-graph linker. If your agent loop *requires* `link` to function, it'll break in stock deployments. Treat it as optional enrichment, not infrastructure.

## Performance Considerations

### Token budget

| Sessions | Full history | GrayMatter | Savings |
|---------:|-------------:|-----------:|--------:|
| 1 | ~80 | ~80 | 0% |
| 10 | ~630 | ~550 | 12% |
| 30 | ~1,880 | ~550 | 71% |
| 100 | ~6,960 | ~670 | **~90%** |

GrayMatter pays off after roughly 10 sessions. For one-shot agents, the overhead may not be worth it. See [`docs/benchmarks.md`](benchmarks.md) for the full methodology.

### Latency

| Operation | Typical | Notes |
|-----------|--------:|-------|
| `memory_add` | 5–20 ms | bbolt write + optional vector upsert |
| `memory_search` | 10–50 ms | Keyword + vector + RRF fusion |
| `checkpoint_save` | 5–15 ms | Single bbolt transaction |
| `checkpoint_resume` | 5–10 ms | Direct key lookup |

Safe to call multiple times per turn. No need to batch.

### Storage growth

```
Per fact: text_bytes + (embedding_dim × 4 bytes)
With nomic-embed-text (768-dim): ~3 KB / fact
1000 facts: ~3 MB on disk
```

Even very large memory stores stay tiny. Don't pre-optimise for storage.

## Configuration Quick Reference

### Environment variables

```bash
# Embedding providers (auto-detected in this order: Ollama → OpenAI → Anthropic → keyword)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # OpenAI embeddings
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # Anthropic embeddings + consolidation LLM

# Or run Ollama locally (default, recommended)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
export GRAYMATTER_OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434     # optional override
export GRAYMATTER_OLLAMA_MODEL=nomic-embed-text         # optional override
export GRAYMATTER_OLLAMA_CONSOLIDATE_MODEL=llama3.2     # local consolidation summariser (ADR-011)
export GRAYMATTER_OPENAI_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small   # optional override
```

Consolidation (`ConsolidateLLM`) accepts `"anthropic"` (needs
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or `"ollama"` — fully local, no key. With Ollama, each
applied cycle replaces the weakest half of an agent's facts with one summary;
the consumed facts stay auditable as tombstones pointing at the summary, and
`status` reports the running totals (`consolidations`, `facts_consumed`).

### Key config fields ([`config.go`](../config.go))

| Field | Default | When to tune |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `DataDir` | `.graymatter` | Move out of the workspace if you don't want it tracked |
| `TopK` | `8` | ↑ to 12 for very dense memory; ↓ to 5 if facts are highly specific |
| `EmbeddingMode` | `EmbeddingAuto` | Force `EmbeddingKeyword` to skip vector search entirely |
| `DecayHalfLife` | `720h` (30 d) | ↓ to 7 d for fast-changing domains; ↑ to 90 d for stable conventions |
| `ConsolidateThreshold` | `20` | ↓ to 10 for aggressive consolidation; ↑ to 50 for retention |
| `AsyncConsolidate` | `true` | Set `false` only in tests / deterministic CI |
| `MaxAsyncConsolidations` | `2` | Concurrency cap on background consolidation |
| `ReadOnly` | `false` | Set `true` to open the store without taking the write lock |

## Quick Decision Trees

### Should I store this?

```
Is it a conclusion / decision / preference?
├── YES → Is it already in code/README?
│   ├── YES → Don't store (reference docs instead)
│   └── NO  → Store it
└── NO  → Is it temporary state?
    ├── YES → Use checkpoint
    └── NO  → Don't store
```

### Which tool?

```
Need to store a fact?
├── Atomic fact ready              → memory_add
├── Long LLM response, multiple    → graymatter.RememberExtracted (Go) or extract yourself
│   insights inside                  before calling memory_add
├── Fix / replace existing fact    → memory_reflect action=update
├── Remove a bad fact              → memory_reflect action=forget
└── Connect two entities (KG)      → memory_reflect action=link  (host must wire SetKGLinker)

Need to retrieve context?
├── Agent-specific only            → memory_search (agent_id=<your-id>)
├── Shared only                    → memory_search (agent_id="__shared__")
├── Both merged                    → two calls, merge yourself  (or use RecallAll in Go)
└── Resume after interruption      → checkpoint_resume
```

### Session-start checklist

- [ ] `checkpoint_resume` — was I interrupted?
- [ ] Inspect only the newest hook block available for this session's initial turn
- [ ] Marker id differs: run both project and `__shared__` searches
- [ ] Marker id matches: search only the scopes whose sections are missing
- [ ] Concatenate into system prompt
- [ ] Proceed with task

### Session-end checklist

- [ ] Extract key learnings from the session
- [ ] `memory_add` for each atomic insight
- [ ] `memory_reflect action=update` for any preferences that changed
- [ ] `checkpoint_save` if the task is incomplete
- [ ] `memory_reflect action=forget` for any temporary / transient facts that slipped in
