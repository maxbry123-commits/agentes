//     might matter" — a condition a model can resolve to false every single
//     time. Triggers are now unconditional and tabulated.
//  2. The agent_id has to be derivable, not invented. A template like
//     `<project>-<role>` produces a different id per session, which scatters
//     facts across namespaces and looks exactly like memory not working.
//  3. A hook's routine recall and an MCP search must not duplicate each other.
//     The hook marker makes that condition observable without taking away
//     checkpoint resume or focused searches.
//
// Param names must match the MCP tool schemas
// (cmd/graymatter/internal/mcp/server.go).

## Memory (GrayMatter)

You have persistent memory through the ~graymatter~ MCP tools. Hooks and MCP are
complementary; neither replaces the other. MCP wiring alone only makes tools
available; this briefing and optional Claude Code hooks define when they run.

This block can be installed globally, so it may reach a project that has no
GrayMatter wired. If ~memory_search~ is not in your toolbelt for this session,
skip the rest of this section. That is a check on what tools exist, not a
judgement call about whether memory seems useful: if the tools are there,
everything below applies.

### Your identity

Your ~agent_id~ is the name of this repository's root directory, used verbatim
every session. Add a ~-<role>~ suffix only when several agents share the repo
(~myapp-backend~, ~myapp-frontend~). Inventing a new id per session scatters
your facts across namespaces and looks exactly like memory being broken.

Facts every agent in the project should see go to the reserved id ~__shared__~.

### Every session, without exception

1. **Resuming long-running work**: call ~checkpoint_resume~ first.
2. **Before your first substantive reply**, inspect only the newest hook block
   available for the session's initial turn; ignore quoted examples and blocks
   from older turns. A real recall block begins with a bracketed
   ~GrayMatter hook recall ran~ marker
   naming its ~agent_id~. If that id differs from the ~agent_id~ you would
   search, run both project and ~__shared__~ searches: cross-namespace dedup may
   have placed a shared duplicate under ~## Memory~. When the ids match, reuse
   each non-empty section and run the search for every missing section. Fold
   all results into your working context before answering.
3. A fresh marker suppresses only those matching routine searches. Keep using
   ~memory_search~ or ~memory_search_batch~ for focused, ad-hoc lookups; hooks
   do not replace MCP writes, reflections, aliases, or checkpoint tools.
4. **Before you stop**, store what you learned (see the table) and call
   ~checkpoint_save~ if the task is unfinished.

### What triggers a call

| When this happens | Call |
|---|---|
| The newest hook block has a different id | ~memory_search~ for both the project and ~__shared__~ |
| A same-id hook block lacks a non-empty section | ~memory_search~ for that missing scope |
| You need additional or focused context | ~memory_search~ or ~memory_search_batch~ |
| The user states a preference | ~memory_add~ |
| You discover a project convention | ~memory_add~ with ~agent_id: "__shared__"~ |
| You make a non-obvious decision | ~memory_add~, include the reasoning |
| You fix a non-trivial bug or find a workaround | ~memory_add~ |
| The user corrects you | ~memory_reflect~ with ~action="update"~ |
| A stored fact becomes wrong | ~memory_reflect~ with ~action="update"~ or ~action="forget"~ (never ~"unpin"~) |
| The user or authoritative project policy declares a stored fact permanent | ~memory_reflect~ with ~action="pin"~ |
| A pinned fact is still true but no longer needs permanence | ~memory_reflect~ with ~action="unpin"~ |
| A search comes back with a **weak-match note** | Reformulate **once** with the note's suggested terms; if your wording and the store's differ, declare it with ~ALIAS_TOOL~ before trying more synonyms |

Prefer durable, actionable, atomic conclusions; skip low-signal, duplicate,
or transient information. Stored facts add retrieval/decay cost. Pin only
facts explicitly designated permanent by the user or authoritative project
guidance.

### The tools

| Tool | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| ~memory_search~ | ~agent_id~, ~query~ | ~top_k~ (default 8), ~explain~ |
| ~memory_search_batch~ | ~agent_id~, ~queries~ | ~top_k~ (default 8) |
| ~memory_add~ | ~agent_id~, ~text~ | |
| ~memory_reflect~ | ~action~, ~agent_id~ (or deprecated ~agent~ alias) | ~text~, ~target~ (required by action) |
| ~ALIAS_TOOL~ | ~agent_id~, ~term~, ~equivalents~ | teach the store a vocabulary bridge |
| ~checkpoint_save~ | ~agent_id~ | ~state~ |
| ~checkpoint_resume~ | ~agent_id~ | |

~agent_id~ is canonical for every tool. ~memory_reflect~ also accepts the
deprecated ~agent~ alias; ~agent_id~ wins when both are set.

### The store learns its own vocabulary

When a search misses because your wording and the store's differ, the store
learns that bridge from use: declare it once with ~ALIAS_TOOL~, or let two
sessions repeat the same unknown word and the store promotes the alias by
itself. ~graymatter alias list~ shows which aliases you taught (~authored~)
and which the store concluded from use (~usage~). A wrong one is revised like
any fact.

### Store conclusions, not transcripts

One idea per call. Skip anything already in the code or the README, anything
transient (that is what checkpoints are for), and never store secrets.
