// Package benchsyn runs the published token-efficiency suite inside the CLI
// binary, so `graymatter bench` can reproduce the numbers without a Go
// toolchain or a repository clone.
//
// Why this lives in the cmd module while benchmarks/token_count (root module)
// carries its own copy of the same corpus: CI builds the CLI with GOWORK=off,
// resolving the library from the last tagged release — a cmd-module import of
// a brand-new root package cannot compile until the next tag lands. Duplicating
// is the price of that invariant; corpus_sync_test.go makes the duplication
// safe by comparing this package's corpus byte-for-byte against the benchmark's,
// on every run.
//
// The measurement itself (fixed-seed shuffle, one-day-per-session backdating,
// per-row fresh store) mirrors benchmarks/token_count exactly; the README gate
// test there keeps both honest against the published tables.
//
// Model: each "session" stores ONE observation — a paragraph extracted from a
// realistic agent interaction, ~50-70 words. "30 sessions" means 30 stored
// observations. "Full injection" = ALL stored observations concatenated.
// "GrayMatter Recall" = top-8 most relevant observations for the given query.
// Token counts are approximated at 1.33 tokens/word (matches tiktoken within ±10%).

EnterpriseGroup will co-develop the agent orchestration framework as a design partner, with their engineering team having early access to APIs 6 weeks before GA.",
	"Initech's internal ML conference paper on domain-specific agent memory was accepted to NeurIPS 2027. Their data science team will present the paper at the conference in December. We are acknowledged in the paper's acknowledgments section. The paper's publication will establish Initech — and by extension GrayMatter — as a reference implementation in the academic literature on AI agent memory.",
	"The GrayMatter annual user conference attracted 850 registered attendees, a 112% increase from the previous year's 400. Speaker lineup: Maria Chen (TechCorp), Ana Torres (Series C co), James Wu (StreamCore), and Marcus Chen (TechnoStar). Three new enterprise logos signed enterprise contracts at the conference. Conference-attributed pipeline: $540k ARR in new opportunities.",
	"OEM revenue from Maria Lopez's platform crossed $10,000/month for the first time, driven by a 20,200 active agent milestone. The OEM agreement is now contributing $120k ARR on an annualized basis. Maria is proposing a white-label option for her largest enterprise customers who want branded experiences. White-label pricing model under commercial review — target pricing: flat $50k/year per white-label deployment.",
	"Total ARR crossed $3M milestone. Customer breakdown: 14 enterprise accounts averaging $180k ARR, 6 mid-market accounts averaging $45k ARR, OEM contributing $120k ARR. Net Revenue Retention for the past 12 months: 134%. Gross Churn: 0% — no customer has churned since inception. Customer Acquisition Cost recovered within an average of 4.2 months.
