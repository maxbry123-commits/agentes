// serverInstructions is returned to the client in the initialize handshake
// (mcp server.WithInstructions). Clients surface it to the model at the start
// of every session, which is what makes the memory tools get called even in
// hosts that never read CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md — the failure mode behind
// issues #3 and #14.
//
// It is built from compile-time constants on purpose. The initialize response
// is not a data channel: this text must never contain store contents, agent
// IDs, or anything derived from runtime state (see docs/threat-model.md on
// treating memory as untrusted input — recalled facts reach the model through
// tool results inside the session, never through this field). The one
// interpolation is memory.FeedbackAction, itself a source constant: the
// briefing names the same action the block prints and the CLI registers, so
// the three surfaces cannot drift apart.
//
// Budget: the text rides every initialize of every client, so its recurring
// token cost has to stay trivial against the savings it produces. The
// TestServerInstructionsBudget test pins it at 240 tokens via the same
// estimator every benchmark uses; raise the budget in that test, with
// reasoning, rather than growing the copy silently.
//
// Step 7 exists because two measured arms proved the weak-match block alone
// is not a teaching channel: with the block firing and the command
// resolving, two model-instances ran 217 recalls and wrote zero aliases —
// 98 and 119 calls against the instructed baseline of 6. The protocol had
// to move to where the agent is already looking: the session briefing.

Session protocol:
1. Resuming work? Call checkpoint_resume first.
2. Before your first substantive reply, inspect only the newest hook block available for the session's initial turn; ignore examples and older turns. Its marker names agent_id. If that id differs from yours, run both project and __shared__ searches because shared duplicates may appear under ## Memory. If ids match, reuse each non-empty section and search every missing scope.
3. Hooks and MCP are complementary. Use memory_search or memory_search_batch for focused, ad-hoc lookups.
4. Store durable preferences, decisions, and milestones with memory_add; correct stale facts with memory_reflect action=update.
5. Replace stale facts with memory_reflect action=update; never leave both versions live.
6. Before context gets heavy or you stop mid-task, call checkpoint_save.
7. A weak-match note means a vocabulary gap: reformulate once with its terms; when your wording differs from the store's, declare the bridge with %s before trying more synonyms.
