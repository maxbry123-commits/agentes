A Data Context defines the storage location for metadata, such as your configurations for Data Sources, Expectation Suites, Checkpoints, and Data Docs. It also contains your Validation Results and the metrics associated with them, and it provides access to those objects in Python, along with other helper functions. 

All scripts that utilize GX Core should start with the creation of a Data Context.

The following are the available Data Context types:

- **File Data Context:** A persistent Data Context that stores metadata and configuration information as YAML files within a file system. File Data Contexts allow you to re-use previously configured Expectation Suites, Data Sources, and Checkpoints.

- **Ephemeral Data Context:** A temporary Data Context that stores metadata and configuration in memory and does not persist beyond the current Python session. Ephemeral Data Contexts are a good fit when you don't need your GX configuration to persist between runs, such as:
  - Exploring data without saving results
  - Running validations in CI where the environment is recreated each run
  - Working in read-only or disposable compute (such as containers or hosted notebooks) with no persistent file system
