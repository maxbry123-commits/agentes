"""
Purpose: guard the installed package against silently dropping the bundled agent
skills or their schema catalogs.

The skills and the two catalog indexes they depend on all ship through
`package_data` glob patterns rather than through code, which means nothing enforces
that the patterns stay in sync with what actually lives in the source tree: a pattern
narrowed by an unrelated edit, or a file added under a directory the patterns do not
reach, fails silently. `pip install .` and `import great_expectations` both succeed
either way, so nothing in the ordinary import-and-run check catches it.

This script is meant to run after `pip install .`, against the resulting installed
package, and checks the properties a user actually depends on:

* the bundled skills resolve the way an installed package resolves them -- through
  the import system, not by checking that some files happen to exist;
* both schema catalog indexes are present, and each schema tree ships more than just
  its index;
* the `skills list` subcommand names every bundled skill;
* installing from the running package produces content that matches its own
  ownership manifest;
* every file the source tree bundles for a skill actually made it into the installed
  package, not just the files that happen to make the skill resolve.

Run directly with `python ci/checks/check_installed_agent_skills.py` from the
repository root, with the package already installed in the active environment.

    Hashing is done with the installer's own ``_tree_digest`` rather than a second,
    independently written function: the manifest's ``content_sha256`` field is defined
    as that function's output, so the only way to ask "does this destination still
    match what its manifest recorded" is to recompute the same function and compare --
    a differently framed hash would disagree with the manifest even for byte-identical
    content, and this check would fail on every run rather than only on a real
    regression. That is not circular, because the two hashes are taken over different
    trees: the manifest's value is computed from the installed package's own bundled
    directory, while this recomputes over the copy placed in the project. Equality is
    therefore a real property of the install pipeline -- that ``shutil.copytree``
