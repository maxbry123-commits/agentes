"""Execution tests for the code in the agent skills bundled with ``great_expectations``.

The skills teach an agent how to drive this library, and every instruction they give is
carried by a code snippet. Markdown is not compiled, imported or linted by anything, so
a snippet that stopped working would keep being handed to users indefinitely. Three
contracts are checked here, each of which fails silently without a test:

1.  **Every fenced Python block parses.** A block is dedented first -- some are nested
    inside list items -- so the check covers the source as an agent would copy it.
2.  **The blocks tagged ``executable`` on their fence really do run, in order, as one
    program.** They are executed against a throwaway in-memory session backed by a local
    SQLite database and an in-memory dataframe, and the run has to reach the end states
    the skills promise: a batch definition proven by reading data through it, a
    validation result carrying one entry per expectation, and a written-out project
    directory that a *fresh* file-backed context opens with its batch definitions and
    suites usable as they are.
3.  **The failure behavior the guidance is built on still behaves that way.** The skills
    tell an agent that retrieving a batch proves nothing, that a false ``success`` means
    two different things, and that empty tables and all-null columns produce ordinary
    results rather than errors. Each of those claims is pinned below against real
    execution, so a change in library behavior fails here -- next to a message naming
    the document whose text has to be updated -- instead of quietly turning the shipped
    guidance into misinformation.

Nothing here reaches the network. Everything runs against a local SQLite file and an
in-memory dataframe, because a check that needs a warehouse is a check that never runs.

The tagging mechanism is the fence itself: ``` ```python executable ``` marks a block as
part of the runnable sequence, which keeps the tag attached to the block it describes
instead of in a list somewhere that content edits can silently invalidate. The order the
tagged blocks run in is ``EXECUTABLE_SEQUENCE``, and its per-document counts are
asserted against the content so a tag that is added, moved or dropped fails loudly
rather than quietly leaving a block unexecuted.

    actually writes through today (see ``action-catalog.md``'s
    ``yml_path = Path(context.root_directory) / "great_expectations.yml"``,
    written through the intermediate variable ``yml_path``).

    Limited to the shapes present in the shipped content: a bare string
    literal, a call to anything named or attribute-accessed as ``Path``
    (``Path("...")``, ``pathlib.Path("...")``, or any other ``x.Path("...")``
    -- see the caveat on that below), a ``/`` join whose left side resolves
    through the same rules, an f-string (always snippet-chosen -- see
    below), and a bare name resolved against ``assignments`` -- the block's
    own single-assignment variables, traced back to their right-hand side
    and then through these same rules.

    That name resolution only traces a name bound by exactly one
    single-target ``ast.Assign`` node anywhere in the block, not at control
    flow -- verified directly rather than assumed:

    - a name reassigned at the top level (more than one ``Assign`` node
      targeting it) is dropped from the map entirely and reads as not
      snippet-chosen -- unresolved, as intended;
    - but a name with exactly one ``Assign`` node that happens to sit inside
      an ``if`` or ``for`` body *is* traced -- ``ast.walk`` finds that one
      node regardless of nesting, so this case resolves and fires just like
      a top-level assignment would;
    - and augmented assignment (``p /= "a.txt"``) is not an ``ast.Assign``
      at all, so it neither adds to the map nor counts toward the
      more-than-once check -- a prior plain assignment to the same name is
      still traced, resolving to that pre-augment value, not to the
      augmented one.

    Every binding form other than a single single-target ``ast.Assign`` is
    unresolved and reads as not snippet-chosen -- not just reassignment and
    destructuring unpacking (``p, q = ...``), but also an annotated
    assignment (``p: Path = ...``, ``ast.AnnAssign``, the idiomatic-typed-Python
    case and the one most likely to actually occur), a chained multi-target
    assignment (``a = b = ...``, excluded by the single-target check), a
    walrus binding (``(p := ...)``, ``ast.NamedExpr``), and a ``for`` (or
    ``with``) loop's own target variable, which is never the target of an
    ``ast.Assign`` at all. The fallback for everything this cannot resolve
    -- an unresolved name, or any other node shape -- is ``return False``,
    i.e. *not* snippet-chosen, *not* flagged. That is an under-firing default,
    the same direction that let the shipped write go unseen before
    ``write_calls_exist`` existed as a non-vacuity guard. It is tolerated
    here only because the shipped corpus contains exactly one write and it
    is the traced ``/``-join-through-an-assigned-variable shape above, not
    because under-firing is generally the safe direction -- contrast the
    ``JoinedStr`` branch below, which deliberately over-fires instead.

    A further caveat this checker does not attempt to close: a write through
    ``.write_bytes(...)`` is outside ``_write_calls`` entirely and this
    function never sees it -- verified directly, 0 calls found for that
    shape. A write through a file handle is not the same blind spot: when
    the handle comes from ``open(path, "w")``, the ``open`` call itself is
    the match (``_write_calls`` yields it, and it fires), so
    ``f = open(p, "w"); f.write(...)`` and
    ``with open(p, "w") as f: f.write(...)`` are both flagged -- on the
    ``open``, not on ``f.write``. What escapes is only a handle obtained
    some other way -- e.g. ``open(p, mode)`` where ``mode`` is a variable
    rather than a string literal, which defeats ``_open_call_is_write_mode``
    and so is never even seen as a write call. And the non-vacuity guard,
    ``write_calls_exist``, only asserts that *some*
    write call exists in the shipped content -- not that every write call is
    correctly classified -- so a future write in a shape this function
    cannot resolve would pass through silently rather than fail loudly.

    The ``/``-join branch below also decides less than its name suggests:
    it accepts *any* left side this function reads as not snippet-chosen,
    not specifically one built from an already-open project's root. A join
    like ``Path(self.own_dir) / "out.yml"`` is accepted identically to
    ``Path(context.root_directory) / "..."`` -- this function has no way to
    distinguish "resolved to a project root" from "resolved to something
    else not literally chosen here." Acceptable under the conservative
    default above, but worth naming precisely rather than implying a
    root-specific check that does not exist.

    The ``Path(...)`` branch has the mirror-image imprecision: it decides
    *more* than its name suggests. It matches any call whose callee is
    either the bare name ``Path`` or *any* attribute access ending in
    ``.Path`` -- ``pathlib.Path(...)``, but identically ``some.other.Path(...)``
    or ``cfg.Path(...)``, verified directly to fire the same as
    ``pathlib.Path``. Over-firing is the safe direction here, and there is
    no false positive on shipped content, but the branch does not actually
    check that the callee resolves to ``pathlib.Path``.
