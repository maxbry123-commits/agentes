//   - `store_id = <current>` for rows written since migration 023, which
//     record which store they were proposed against directly.
//   - `store_id IS NULL AND created_at >= <paired_at>` for older rows,
//     whose provenance can only be inferred from a timestamp.
//
// The NULL branch is why both tests exist. Migration 023 deliberately
// doesn't backfill — stamping old rows with the current store id would
// claim provenance we don't have and would re-admit exactly the proposals
// this is meant to exclude. So pre-migration rows keep the timestamp
// behavior, and new rows get the precise check. The NULL branch can be
// dropped once no pre-023 rows remain in any install worth supporting.
//
// Right after a re-pair, both branches exclude everything and specialists
// show generics until the personas have proposed against the new catalog.
// That's correct: we genuinely don't know those products exist yet, and
// the issue's acceptance criteria call for staying generic rather than
// guessing.

// said no to those, and leading the empty-thread state with them invites
