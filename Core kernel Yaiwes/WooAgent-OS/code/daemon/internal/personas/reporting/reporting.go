// Package reporting is the Reporting agent persona.
//
// Draft is a dormant stub today — the original product_health_digest skill
// was retired 2026-05-18 when Marketing's cold-draft batch workflow took
// over the empty-copy workflow. Until a real reporting skill lands
// (sales summaries, KPI digests, or equivalent), the persona is
// intentionally NOT registered in the personas registry, so:
//
//   - GET /v1/agents reports Implemented=false for any historical row
//     (operators who previously enabled Reporting see "Coming soon" rather
//     than dead controls).
//   - PATCH /v1/agents/{slug=reporting} returns 404 (no opt-in path).
//   - The UI's Add Agent modal does not offer Reporting.
//
// The Go-side persona type and methods are preserved so re-enabling once
// skills are wired is a one-line change (un-comment the Register call).
