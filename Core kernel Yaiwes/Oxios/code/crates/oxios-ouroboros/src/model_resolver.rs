//! Model resolution port — the single source of truth for "which model does
//! this task use".
//!
//! Both the Ouroboros phases (interview / crystallize / review) and the
//! kernel's `AgentRuntime` (execute) resolve the active model through this
//! port, reading the live engine's default model. This eliminates the
//! divergence where interview used a boot-time-captured model while execute
//! re-resolved a frozen string — the phases now agree by construction, and a
//! bad model ID surfaces at the first phase call rather than silently at
//! execute.
//!
//! # Why a trait here (not the kernel)?
//!
//! `OuroborosEngine` lives in this crate and cannot depend on `oxios-kernel`
//! (the dependency runs the other way: kernel → ouroboros). So the engine
//! holds an `Arc<dyn ModelResolver>` — a port it owns — and the kernel's
//! `EngineHandle` implements it. Classic dependency inversion: the trait
//! belongs to the consumer.
