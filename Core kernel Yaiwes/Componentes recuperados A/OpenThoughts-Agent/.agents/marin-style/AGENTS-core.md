# Marin Coding Standards (Core)

Portable coding standards, agent conventions, and code-review expectations shared
across Marin-community repositories. Reference this file from the repo's root
`AGENTS.md` so coding agents pick it up automatically.

## Development

```bash
# Lint and format — the required entry point for this repo.
infra/pre-commit.py --all-files --fix
```

- `infra/pre-commit.py` is the required lint entry point. It is a thin shim that
  runs the shared `marin-style` checks. Do not replace it with `uv run pre-commit`.
- Type checking runs as part of the pre-commit pass; keep type hints passing.
- Run the lint-review pass (`infra/pre-commit.py --review`) before opening a PR,
  and fix or answer every finding it reports.

## Communication & Commits

- NEVER SAY "You're absolutely right!"
- NEVER credit yourself, in commit messages or in PR/issue bodies. No
  `Co-Authored-By` trailer, no "Generated with …" line, no emoji attribution —
  even if a tool default suggests one.
- When an agent creates a PR or issue, add the `agent-generated` label.
- Agent *comments* on PRs/issues must begin with `🤖` unless the exact text was
  explicitly approved by the user. This applies to comments only — never put a
  `🤖` marker in a commit message or a PR/issue body.
- All agent-authored commit, PR, and issue titles and bodies must follow
  `.agents/skills/writing-style/SKILL.md` and its PR or issue guide. Review the
  exact text that will be published, then apply `ai-writing-donts.md` as a final
  compression pass. Do not publish raw implementation notes, test narration,
  prompt-shaped headings, or claims that use emphasis in place of evidence.
- A PR description is the squash-merge commit message. Keep every fact a future
  reader needs to understand the behavior and rationale, including measured
  results and caveats when they affect review. Remove headings, diff narration,
  and implementation inventories; put extended history in a linked issue,
  design doc, logbook, or artifact. Follow the `commit` skill
  (`.agents/skills/commit/SKILL.md`) when committing, pushing, or opening a PR.

## Ecosystem Costs

- Never read or write large amounts of data across cloud regions or to the open
  internet without explicit approval; storage and bandwidth are major cost
  drivers. Cross-region transfers in particular need a human sign-off.
- Never stop, restart, or bounce a shared cluster (e.g. an Iris cluster) unless
  the user gives express permission.

## Code Style

- All imports at the top of the file. No local imports except to break circular
  dependencies or guard optional deps. No `TYPE_CHECKING` guards — fix cycles
  structurally via protocols.
- Prefer top-level functions over classes when code does not mutate shared state.
  Reduce deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting.
- Document public APIs with concise Google-style docstrings. Skip docstrings on
  trivial functions with clear names.
- Prefer `dataclasses.replace` over mutating config arguments in-place.
- Prefer logging over `print` (except in scripts and debugging).
- Resolve environment-dependent defaults once and fail fast on unknown inputs.
- No ad-hoc compatibility hacks (`hasattr(m, "old_attr")`); update code
  consistently.
- Prefer small concrete helpers over abstraction that adds indirection without
  reuse. Start simple; abstract only under real pressure.
- Delete dead code: unused parameters, stale options, old experiments.
- Top-level constants for magic strings/numbers.
- Separate computation from I/O (split compute from upload/write).
- Use context managers for resource lifecycle.

## Naming

- No `*_utils.py` — use descriptive names like `text_cleaning.py`.
- Function names should reflect return types (`probe_task` → `task_status`).
- No `_s` suffix for seconds (assumed throughout). No abbreviations like `exe` —
  use `exec` or full words.

## Types & Data Structures

- Dataclass/namedtuple over raw dicts. `StrEnum` over string keys.
- Use `Protocol` for decoupling; avoid hard-coupling to concrete types.
- Avoid `X | str` unions that require `isinstance` checks — pick one input type.
- Replace compound booleans encoding state with an enum.

## Configuration

- No `default_*` wrappers that obscure underlying mechanisms.
- Force explicit specification of critical parameters (no silent defaults).
- Centralize defaults in one canonical location.
- Prefer explicit constructor/config parameters over env vars.
- Composition over inheritance: embed sub-configs, don't subclass.

## API Design

- Accept only what's necessary. Replace boolean flags with meaningful parameters
  (e.g., `num_workers: int` instead of `parallel: bool`).
- Use separate classes over boolean flags for variant behavior
  (`NativeVllm` / `DockerVllm`, not `Vllm(docker=True)`).
- Normalize inputs to a standard format once at the boundary, not throughout.

## Error Handling

- Let exceptions propagate by default.
- Only catch to add meaningful context and re-raise, or to intentionally alter
  control flow.
- NEVER swallow exceptions unless specifically requested.
- Assert liberally; prefer `raise ValueError` over silent fallbacks.

## Documentation

- Keep docs in sync with code. Use Markdown and standard links.
- Write docs that stand alone without conversational context.

## Deprecation

**NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Update all call sites instead. Only add
compatibility shims if the user explicitly requests it.

## Comments

- Write comments for module/class-level behavior or subtle logic. Do not restate
  the code.
- Delete stale comments immediately on discovery.
- Inline comments to clarify non-obvious boolean arguments.

## LLM-Generated Code Pitfalls

Watch for and eliminate these patterns in generated code:

- Over-protective try/except and defensive None checks.
- Tautological tests (type exists, constant has value).
- Verbose/redundant docstrings and `__all__` in `__init__.py`.
- Boolean dispatch instead of separate classes.
- Environment variables instead of explicit parameters.

## Code Reuse

Before writing any utility function, helper, or data structure:

1. Search the codebase for existing implementations.
2. Check the project's own shared modules and packages.
3. Check the dependency manifest (`pyproject.toml`) for available third-party
   packages before adding a new one.

If a suitable implementation exists, use it. Do not create parallel
implementations.

## Testing

See `TESTING.md` for the behavior-focused testing policy: what makes a good test,
which "slop" tests to reject, the mocks/fakes policy, timing, numerical
tolerances, and pytest style. Read it before writing or reviewing tests.
