//! Whether a turn set to Claude is answered by the `claude` program.
//!
//! Everything about the translation is covered beside it: the schema, the
//! conversation, the argument vector and the fold each have a unit test in
//! `llm/claude.rs`, and none of them spawns anything. What none of them can see
//! is the seam this suite exists for, which is that a config naming this
//! provider reaches that transport at all. Drop the branch in `stream_chat` and
//! every one of those unit tests still passes, while every turn in every
//! workspace goes to an endpoint the operator did not choose.
//!
//! ## Why there is a program on `PATH` here and not a mock
//!
//! The same reason `coding.rs` has one: the thing being tested is a process.
//! `claude::stream` spawns a binary by name, writes a conversation to its stdin
//! and reads its stdout as one JSON object per line. A fake in front of that
//! would be a test of the fold. So the stand-in below is a real executable,
//! found on `PATH` the way the real one is, and it answers on the basis of what
//! it was actually handed on stdin, which is the half a fold test cannot reach:
//! a conversation that never arrives is a program that waits, and a program
//! that waits looks exactly like a model that is thinking.
//!
//! The one thing this cannot check is whether the real program still accepts
//! that command line and still answers in that shape. That is what the
//! `#[ignore]`d test at the bottom is for, and it is the same live half
//! `coding.rs`, `subscription.rs` and `plugins.rs` each keep for the reason.
