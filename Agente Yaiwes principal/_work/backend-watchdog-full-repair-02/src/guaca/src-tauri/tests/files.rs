//! Files moving between the operator, the agents, and their machines.
//!
//! The thing being tested is not that bytes were stored. It is that the file
//! reaches the model in a form it can act on, and that when it cannot, the
//! model is told rather than left to talk about a document nobody sent. A
//! silently dropped attachment is the worst failure available here: everyone
//! involved, agent and operator, believes the file arrived.
//!
//! What CI can reach is everything up to the sandbox. Placing a document on an
//! agent's machine needs a real E2B key, so those paths are exercised here for
//! their failure behavior and verified for real by `./scripts/evals.sh`.
