//! Signing in to a Guaca account, which nobody has to do.
//!
//! Guaca runs on this machine with the operator's own keys and stays that way.
//! An account is one optional thing: a hosted OAuth client, so an agent can
//! reach a service that will only issue programmatic access to a registered
//! application. Gmail is the example. Guaca cannot be that application, because
//! its client secret would be in the download, and no amount of local
//! cleverness changes that. `guaca.bot` can be, and holds the refresh token so
//! this machine never has to.
//!
//! An install that never signs in never talks to it. Everything else in the app
//! works exactly the same either way, and that is a property to keep rather than
//! a phase to grow out of.
//!
//! ## Why this is the third OAuth flow and not a copy of the first
//!
//! [`crate::subscription`] uses the device flow and argues for it: a fixed
//! loopback port may already belong to something else, and a URL scheme is
//! claimed by whichever build registered last. [`crate::oauth`] answers both
//! objections for MCP plugins by binding `127.0.0.1:0` *before* naming the
//! redirect, so the port is one the operating system has already handed out.
//! This module is that second answer pointed at one known server.
//!
//! The choice matters more here than anywhere else in the app. A device code is
//! a bearer secret carried by a human, and RFC 8628 section 5.4 says what
//! follows: nothing binds the code to the machine that asked for it, so anyone
//! who can talk an operator into approving one walks away with a token that
//! mints Gmail access tokens on that operator's account. RFC 8252 is the
//! standing advice for a native application with a browser, and this is it: an
//! authorization code, bound to this process by a PKCE verifier that never
//! leaves it, delivered to a port on this machine. A code lifted off the wire is
//! worth nothing without the verifier, and a code delivered to `127.0.0.1` on
//! somebody else's machine never reaches this one.
//!
//! ## Where the service is, and where it is not
//!
//! [`DEFAULT_ORIGIN`], a constant, overridable only through the environment and
//! never through settings. The reason is `subscription.rs`'s: a mistyped sign-in
//! service is a credential sent somewhere nobody chose. The override exists so
//! the flow can be run end to end against a Worker on this machine, and it is
//! refused for anything that is neither HTTPS nor loopback.
//!
//! ## What is stored, and where
//!
//! Its own file, for the reason `subscription.rs` gives: the token set rotates
//! on refresh, which is Guaca writing in the background, and `config.json` is
//! rewritten wholesale whenever the operator presses Save. Two writers on one
//! file lose a refreshed token to a stale in-memory copy.
//!
//! Plaintext and 0600, and the same caveat applies with the same force. This
//! credential is not Guaca's to lose: it stands for an account that can mint
//! access tokens for the operator's mail. The honest fix is the OS keychain, and
//! it is the first thing to reach for if this file grows a second reader.
