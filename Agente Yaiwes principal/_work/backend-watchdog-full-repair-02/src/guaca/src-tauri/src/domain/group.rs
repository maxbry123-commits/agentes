//! Groups: the isolation boundary between agents, and the settings they run on.
//!
//! Every agent belongs to exactly one group, and agents in different groups
//! cannot reach each other. That is not a UI filter. `directory` only lists
//! peers from the caller's own group, and a send addressed to a name outside it
//! is refused as an unknown recipient, so from inside a group the rest of the
//! roster does not exist.
//!
//! Agents are never told what a group is. There is no group tool, nothing in
//! the system prompt, and no way to enumerate or address one. An agent that
//! cannot observe the boundary cannot be talked across it, which is a stronger
//! guarantee than a rule in a prompt and needs no cooperation from the model.
//!
//! The operator is not in a group. A human can open any agent and talk to it;
//! the wall is between agents.
//!
//! There is always at least one group, created by the migration that introduced
//! them, so "no group" is not a state the rest of the app has to handle.
//!
//! A group is also where a crew's settings live. App settings are defaults: how
//! a turn is paid for, which model answers it, and how far a conversation may
//! run are all decided per group, and only fall back to the app when the group
//! says nothing. `None` is that silence throughout, at every layer: in the
//! draft the operator sends, in the columns, and in the resolved overrides. An
//! empty string is a field an operator blanked, which means inherit too, and is
//! normalized to `None` on the way in so the two can never disagree.
