/// ## Why it is per agent
///
/// A browser is given to one agent, and what is in it is the operator's
/// accounts. Giving an agent the browser is the decision about those accounts:
/// there is nothing an agent can do with a page it was handed that the operator
/// did not hand it. So the answer belongs beside `has_browser`, on the agent,
/// for the reason [`crate::domain::repository::Gate`] belongs on the
/// repository. It is a fact about how work happens *here*.
///
/// ## Why it is not per site
///
/// The gate this switches off asks per site, in the turn, and no answer it can
/// collect is the answer an operator actually holds. "Post on the company
/// LinkedIn, never on my own" is one account divided by intent, and a rule that
/// only knows domains cannot express it, so asking harder produces a dialog per
/// site that is answered without reading and still gets the interesting case
/// wrong. What can hold that instruction is the model, told plainly. What the
/// operator gets to decide here is which agents are trusted to follow it.
///
/// ## Why the default is open
///
/// Because giving the browser already was the decision, and an agent doing
/// research presses something on a search engine every few seconds. Asking
/// about each one trains the operator to approve without looking, which is
/// worse than not asking: the one prompt that mattered arrives in a habit of
