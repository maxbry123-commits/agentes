//! are one row: what to do, and what makes it happen.
//!
//! What is stored is the next due time rather than a running timer, so a
//! schedule survives a restart. Nothing has to be held in memory for a routine
//! to fire tomorrow.
//!
//! Not every routine waits on a clock. A [`Trigger`] is either a [`Cadence`],
//! which owns a moment and is what the scheduler sweeps for, or an
//! [`EventTrigger`], which owns nothing and waits to be told. The second kind
//! has no next moment, which is why the moment is an `Option` here and nullable
//! in SQLite: a routine waiting on Stripe with a slot in it would either fire
//! on the clock or need a sentinel, and a sentinel is a date the operator would
