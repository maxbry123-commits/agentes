-- An escalation: work that has stopped and that only the operator can move.
--
-- There were two ways for an agent to reach a person and both of them park the
-- turn inside a tool call, waiting ten minutes for an answer. Both are right
-- for a decision the turn needs now. Neither is right for the case they kept
-- being reached for anyway, which is an agent that cannot go on at all: a
-- coding harness that will not start, a sign-in that has expired, a machine
-- only the operator can touch. None of that is answerable inside a turn and
-- none of it stops being true because ten minutes passed, so the agent wrote it
-- into its channel instead, clearly, addressed to somebody who was not reading
-- it. Five turns of one crew went that way before anybody noticed, and what
-- made it invisible is that the three surfaces built for exactly this -- the
-- count on a crew's circle, the desk, the menu bar -- are all fed from
-- `approvals`. Nothing had parked, so all three said the workspace was fine.
--
-- Nothing parks here either, and that is the difference rather than an
-- omission: the turn ends, no run booking is held, and so there is no window,
-- no expiry, and no cost to a row staying open for two days. Nothing is
-- answered either. Clearing is the operator saying they have dealt with it;
-- what actually unblocks the agent is a message in the channel this row opens.
--

-- not fill the desk with six rows saying one thing, and must not be told to
-- keep quiet either: the sixth raise restates the line, counts, and leaves

-- Where a coding job in this directory actually runs.
--
-- Until today it ran in the linked directory, which is the operator's own
-- checkout, and that made three things true at once. The job and the operator
-- shared one branch. Two agents in one codebase could not work at the same
-- time, because `Runtime::start_job` takes a lock per work tree and there was
-- only ever one. And a job that opened a pull request left the tree standing on
-- the branch it made, so the rail went on reporting a feature branch for the
-- weeks after it landed.
--
-- `'own'` gives each agent a linked git worktree of its own, off the same
-- repository, under the app's data directory. The operator's checkout is never
-- checked out, never switched and never cleaned; Guaca owns the other tree and
-- so can reset it to the default branch before every job.
--
-- `'shared'` is what every row written before today was doing, so that is what
-- they are backfilled with. This is the one column in this table whose SQL
-- default and whose Rust default disagree, and the disagreement is the point:
-- `ALTER TABLE ... DEFAULT` only ever runs against rows that already exist, and
-- moving somebody's jobs into a new directory is not an upgrade's decision to
-- take. What a *new* repository gets is `Bench::default`, which is `own`, and
-- `create_repository` always writes the value explicitly.
--
-- Unrecognized values read back as `shared` rather than failing the row, for

--

-- The crew's own calendar: dates it is answerable for.
--
-- Not the operator's real calendar, which is the Google plugin's job and is
-- read rather than kept. This is the half nothing in the app held. An agent
-- that learned a filing was due on the 15th, that a customer had moved a call,
-- or that a contract lapsed at month end had three stores to choose from and
-- all three were wrong: memory is what an agent knows and outlives the date, a
-- working note expires on its own and carries no moment, and a routine is work
-- the agent will do rather than a thing that is happening. What none of them
-- can be read as is "what is coming", which is the one question a calendar
-- answers.
--
-- Nothing here fires. A row is a fact, not a timer, and that is deliberate
-- rather than unfinished: `routines` is the table that wakes an agent up, and
-- folding the two together would turn every note about a customer's schedule
-- into an agent running at 3am.
--
-- `group_id` is the wall and is why this table is not keyed on the agent. A
-- crew shares one calendar, every agent in it reads the same list, and no agent
-- can reach another crew's. It is `REFERENCES groups(id)` without a cascade,
-- matching every other group-scoped table here: `Store::delete_group` takes the
-- rows out itself, in order, because these foreign keys are enforced.
--
-- `agent_id` is nullable, and NULL is the operator's own writes rather than a
-- deleted agent's: deleting an agent marks the row terminated and never removes
-- it, so this cascade is the same standing belt every other agent-scoped table
-- here wears. What is different is what a deletion does *not* do. A deleted
-- agent's memory, schedule and working notes go with it because they are the
-- agent's own; its occasions stay, because a board meeting does not stop
-- happening when the agent that heard about it is let go, and the calendar it
-- is on belongs to the crew.
--
-- `starts_at` is an instant for both kinds of row, and an all-day one holds
-- local midnight of its day with `all_day` set. That is what lets one column,
-- one index and one ORDER BY serve a deadline and a three o'clock call at once.
-- Midnight alone could not: it is a real time somebody might have chosen, and a
-- filing drawn as "12:00 AM" is a filing nobody reads as a deadline.
--
-- `minutes` is null for a moment with no stated end, which is most of them, and
-- is always null when `all_day` is set. A day has no length to state.
