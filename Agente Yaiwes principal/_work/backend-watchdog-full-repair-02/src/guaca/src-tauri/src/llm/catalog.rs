//! What OpenRouter is asked to do, and which models it hands that work to.
//!
//! Beside `openrouter.rs` because it is the same vendor, and separate from it
//! because it is not the same conversation: that file is how a turn is spent,
//! this one is read once while a dialog is open and never during a turn. No
//! agent, prompt, tool or guard reads anything here.
//!
//! ## Why the ranking is not the one the endpoint returns by default
//!
//! `?category=` orders by how many tokens OpenRouter routed to each model for
//! that kind of work, which sounds like the answer and is not. Bulk traffic
//! dominates it: the same cheap high-throughput model tops eleven of the twelve
//! use cases, so a picker built on that order suggests one model for every
//! agent and says something different each time about why. The category is
//! still what makes the list relevant — it is the set of models people actually
//! send this kind of work to — so it decides the pool, and `sort=` decides the
//! order inside it. Capability, from the index OpenRouter publishes on the same
//! response, is what makes twelve pools read as twelve answers.
//!
//! ## Why the use cases are checked here
//!
//! OpenRouter answers an unrecognized category with 200 and an empty list, so a
//! slug that has been renamed on their side is indistinguishable from a use case
//! nobody sends work to. Checking against the published set before spending a
//! request turns the first case into a sentence naming what was asked for, and
//! leaves the empty answer meaning only one thing.
