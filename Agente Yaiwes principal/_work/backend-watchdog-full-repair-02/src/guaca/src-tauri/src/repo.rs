//! Whether a directory is one an agent may be given.
//!
//! One question, asked by running git rather than by looking for a `.git`
//! entry. A work tree that is a linked worktree, a submodule, or a checkout
//! whose `.git` is a file rather than a directory all answer correctly to git
//! and all fool a directory check, and each of those is somebody's ordinary
//! setup rather than an exotic case. Asking git also answers a second question
//! for free: whether git is installed at all, which whatever works in the
//! directory later is going to need.
//!
//! This is where a repository stops being a string. Everything above it in
//! [`crate::domain::repository`] is the shape and the rules that need no disk;
//! this is the disk.
//!
//! ## The directory is on this machine
//!
//! Not on an agent's sandbox. The operator picks a directory they already have,
//! with work already in it, and that is the whole point of the feature: an
//! agent that can only see a fresh clone cannot see the branch you are on, the
//! change you have not committed, or the toolchain your repository actually
//! builds with.
//!
//! What makes that defensible is not this check. It is the three things around
//! it: the operator picks the path and no model ever supplies one, git is the
//! undo, and the process that works in there is confined to it. This function
//! is the first of the three and the cheapest, and it must never be described
//! as the boundary.
