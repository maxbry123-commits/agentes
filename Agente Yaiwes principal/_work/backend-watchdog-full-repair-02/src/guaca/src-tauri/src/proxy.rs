//! The local viewer for an agent's computer.
//!
//! Sandboxes are created with `allow_public_traffic: false`, so every request
//! to their public URLs must carry an `e2b-traffic-access-token` header. That
//! is exactly what an embedded viewer cannot do: an iframe cannot set a header,
//! and neither can a browser WebSocket. Leaving the traffic open instead would
//! put an agent's desktop, logged-in sessions and all, behind nothing but an
//! unguessable id.
//!
//! So the webview points at `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/{sandbox}/{sandboxPort}/…`
//! and this relays it, attaching the token on the way out.
//!
//! The relay is byte-level rather than a request parser. Only the head is read
//! and rewritten; after that both directions are spliced until one side closes.
//! That is what lets one implementation carry the HTML, the assets and noVNC's
//! RFB socket, which is a WebSocket upgrade and cannot be handled by an ordinary
//! HTTP client.
//!
//! Paths keep the `/{sandbox}/{port}` prefix because noVNC references its own
//! files relatively: from `/{sandbox}/6080/vnc.html`, `app/ui.js` resolves back
//! through the same prefix without anything having to rewrite the HTML.
