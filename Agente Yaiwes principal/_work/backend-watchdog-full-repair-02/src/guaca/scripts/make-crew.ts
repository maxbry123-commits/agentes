/**
 * Draws the crew strip in the README.
 *
 * Rendered from the app's own drawing code rather than redrawn: `form.ts` for
 * the body, `eyes.ts` for the face, `moods.ts` for the expression. A redesign
 * updates the front page by re-running this rather than by somebody noticing
 * the picture is out of date, which is what happened to the cast before this
 * one.
 *
 *   ./scripts/make-crew.sh
 *
 * One frame, held still. The strip has to say in a static picture what the app
 * says by moving, so what varies down the row is the expression: eight
 * characters, eight moods, eight directions of gaze. The eight are chosen to
 * cover all five silhouettes, because the strip is also the only place a reader
 * sees the cast is more than one shape.
