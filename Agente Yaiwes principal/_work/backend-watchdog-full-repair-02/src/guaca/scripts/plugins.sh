# The live plugin test: whether the five vendors still publish what this build

# CI cannot answer this. Everything in the offline suite is a scripted server
# agreeing with what this app believes MCP authorization looks like, and the
# failure worth catching is that belief going stale: a vendor can move an
# endpoint, stop offering dynamic client registration, or start asking for a
# token on a server that used to be open, and every offline test keeps passing
# while no operator can connect.

# It reaches the real internet and spends nothing: no account is authorized, no
# browser is opened and no tool is called.
