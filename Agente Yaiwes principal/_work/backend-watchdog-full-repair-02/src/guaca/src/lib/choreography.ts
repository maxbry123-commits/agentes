/**
 * Paces inter-agent messages so you can actually watch one happen.
 *
 * The runtime is real-time: a fan-out to four agents lands four messages within
 * a few milliseconds of each other. Animating them the moment they arrive means
 * four parcels crossing at once and every character reacting simultaneously, which
 * is over before the eye can follow it.
 *
 * So delivery and choreography are decoupled. Messages are already delivered by
 * the time they reach here; this only decides when the drawing of each one
 * plays. Each message gets a visible beat of its own:
 *
 *   aim     both characters turn to face each other, sender shouts
 *   flight  the parcel crosses the wire
 *   catch   the recipient takes the hit and settles
 *
 * Simultaneous messages are staggered rather than serialized, so a burst still
 * finishes promptly while each throw stays individually legible.
