/**
 * What order the rail draws agents in.
 *
 * Two orders, not one. The arrangement is what the operator dragged into place
 * and it is durable, held as `railOrder` on the card. Activity is a loan: an
 * agent that is working is lifted to the top of its section for as long as it
 * is working, and the place goes back the moment it stops.
 *
 * The rail used to have only the second half, ordered by who spoke last for as
 * long as that stayed true, which meant the list you reached into was the list
 * that had just moved and no arrangement could survive a conversation. Keeping
 * both halves is what makes a drag worth doing: the shape you arranged is the
 * shape the rail returns to.
 *
 * A pin is a third thing and the shortest: it holds a row at the head of its
 * crew, in every view that draws that crew, and it never lends the place back.

 * and dropping on one asks for membership without saying where in it.
 *
 * A repository is the third and it is the one that is not a move. Dropping on a
 * crew takes the agent out of the crew it was in, because an agent is in
 * exactly one; dropping on a repository adds a directory to what it can work
 * in, and it can work in several. Two gestures that look identical and mean
 * different things, which is why the sections they land on are drawn as
 * different furniture rather than as two lists of rows.
