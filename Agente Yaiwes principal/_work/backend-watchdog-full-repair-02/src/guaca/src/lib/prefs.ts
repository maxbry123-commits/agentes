 * interface draws, whether the reading column is paper or ink, which of four
 * things is worth interrupting you for: the runtime would carry these across
 * IPC only to hand them straight back.
 *
 * So they stay on this side, in `localStorage`, the way the inspector's
 * open-or-closed already does. That is a deliberate exception to "the frontend
 * holds nothing durable" and it is narrow on purpose: nothing in here survives
 * being lost, and none of it is worth a migration.
 *
 * One blob under one key rather than a key each, so a read is one parse and a
 * write is one string. Every field is validated on the way in: this file is a
 * text file an operator can edit, a webview can truncate and an older build can
 * have written, and a preference that cannot be read should cost the default
 * rather than the window.
