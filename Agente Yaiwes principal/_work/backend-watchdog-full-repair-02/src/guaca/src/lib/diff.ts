 * and the wrong one for whoever has to read the result: every write arrives as
 * the whole page, and "what did it decide to remember this time" means holding
 * two near-identical pages in your head and comparing them by eye.
 *
 * Line-level and nothing finer. A memory is a page of markdown written in
 * sentences, so a line is the unit an agent changes and the unit a person
 * reads; picking out the three words inside a rewritten sentence would draw
 * attention to the smallest part of the smallest change.
 *
 * Every unchanged line is kept, unlike a patch, which folds them away. A page
 * is short enough to show whole, and showing it whole answers the other
 * question the operator has when they open this: not only what changed, but
 * what the agent now believes.
