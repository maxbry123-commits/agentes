/**
 * The gates a notification has to pass, read from the refusals inward.
 *
 * Every interesting assertion in this file is about silence. Raising a
 * notification is one call; the work is declining to, and each way of getting
 * that wrong costs the operator the whole feature, because nobody who turns
 * notifications off turns them back on again. A badge for a routine that fired
 * in the channel they were watching, a second badge for the same failure, a
 * weekend of overdue schedule announced at launch: any one of those and the
 * switch goes off for good.
 *
 * The judgment is in `Moment`. "Away" is graded, not binary, so the same three
 * booleans mean three different things depending on the kind, and the class
 * table is the only thing that says which. A kind that quietly changes class is
 * a permission request nobody is told about, or a settled run announced from a
 * channel that has never been opened.
 *
 * `away` itself is two conditions rather than one. A window sitting behind a
 * browser on the same screen is visible and unfocused, which is exactly the
 * case worth interrupting for and the one `document.hidden` misses.
