 * How large the interface draws, and whether the reading column is paper or ink.

 * Both are one write to the root element, because both are already expressed in
 * `styles.css` as one thing: every size in the stylesheet is a `rem`, so scale
 * is a root font size, and every color the reading column uses is a custom
 * property, so the surface is a token block behind an attribute.
 *
 * The rail is not part of either question. It owns `--rail-*`, it is dark in
 * both surfaces by design, and nothing here names those tokens. What scale does
 * to it is what scale does to everything: it grows.
 *
 * `system` is resolved here rather than in a media query. A media query would
 * mean the dark token block written twice, once for the chosen mode and once
 * inside `prefers-color-scheme`, with no way for CSS to share it; two copies of
 * eighteen colors that must agree is a worse bargain than one listener.
