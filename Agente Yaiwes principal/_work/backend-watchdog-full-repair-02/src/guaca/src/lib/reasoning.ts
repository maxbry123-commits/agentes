/**
 * What a turn shows of its own thinking.
 *
 * A model that publishes its working produces it as fast as it writes an
 * answer, and none of it is kept: the runtime addresses it to the placeholder
 * rather than to a channel, and the store drops it when the stream ends. What
 * is decided here is how much of it is held while it runs, and how the one line
 * that is drawn without being asked for is read.
 *
 * The whole turn is held, because the operator can ask to see it. What is drawn
 * is not the tail of it. A tail replaced sixty times a second says a turn is
 * alive and nothing else, which is what this was: through a wait that can run
 * to ten minutes it is a flicker nobody can read a word of. Two things make it
 * legible, and neither invents anything the model did not write.
 *
 * - **The heading is the model's own.** Reasoning arrives as prose with section
 *   headings in it, and a heading changes every half minute rather than every
 *   frame. It is the label, so the eye has something to hold on to and the
 *   answer to "what is it doing" survives longer than a glance.
 * - **The line under it is the last sentence that finished.** Nobody reads a
 *   sentence as it is typed. Waiting for the period costs a second or two of
 *   staleness and buys a line that can actually be read.
 *
 * Everything else is behind the disclosure, where it is the model's working as
 * written and this file has no opinion about it.
 */

/**
 * Characters of thinking held per agent.
 *
 * A ceiling, not a budget. A turn that reasons for ten minutes writes tens of
 * kilobytes and all of it is worth having behind the disclosure, but a stream
 * that never ends must not grow the window without bound. The head goes first,
 * because the panel follows the end and the newest words are the ones being
 * waited on.
