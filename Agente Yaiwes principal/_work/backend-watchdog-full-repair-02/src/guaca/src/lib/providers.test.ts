/**

 *
 * `providerFor` decides which row the dialog draws as chosen, so it has to
 * survive the two ways an operator's paste differs from the same URL and it
 * has to refuse everything else: a hand-typed endpoint must read as chosen,
 * not as one of these with the highlight on the wrong row. And because the
 * Rust side normalizes a base URL before it stores one, a preset that is not
 * already in that canonical form saves fine and comes back unrecognized, which
 * looks like the app forgetting the choice that was just made.
 *
 * Nothing here needs a running app. A preset the backend would rewrite, or one
 * that cannot find itself, is wrong the moment it is written.
