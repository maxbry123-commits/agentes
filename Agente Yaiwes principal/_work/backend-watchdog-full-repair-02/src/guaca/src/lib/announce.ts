/**
 * Turning runtime events into the five things worth interrupting someone for.
 *
 * Kept apart from `notify`, which decides *whether* to interrupt, and from
 * `App`, which is a view. This decides *what* the interruption would say, and
 * it is a pure function of one event so it can be argued with in a test rather
 * than in a running window.
 *
 * Four of the five kinds are read out of the event stream directly. The other
 * is not: `runSettled` says which run ended and nothing about where it
 * happened, and "only tell me about the channel I was looking at" needs a
 * channel. So the one piece of state here is a run's channel, learned from the
 * `streamStarted` that opened in it and forgotten when the run ends. It is the
 * smallest thing that answers the question, and it cleans itself up on the same
 * event it is needed for.

 * at this" against that channel answers a question nobody asked. The channel a
 * run opened in is the one the operator was in when they set it off.
 *
 * Bounded by the runs in flight rather than by the runs there have ever been,
 * because every entry is removed by the `runSettled` that made it interesting.
 * A run that never settles would leak one entry, and that is a defect the
 * trajectory suite fails on long before it is a memory problem here.
