/**
 * How each plugin is drawn. Its mark, and nothing else.
 *
 * Everything a plugin *is* — its name, what it offers, where it signs in — comes
 * from Rust, because Rust is what dials the endpoint. A second copy of that here
 * would be a second place for it to be wrong. What is left on this side is the
 * part the runtime has no use for: a logo and a color.
 *
 * The marks are Simple Icons (https://simpleicons.org), CC0 1.0, copied in as
 * path data rather than pulled as a dependency: a handful of glyphs do not
 * justify a package carrying three thousand. Trademarks belong to their owners.
 *
 * AgentMail is the exception and is drawn here, because it is not in that set.
 * A generic envelope rather than an approximation of their logo: a mark nobody
 * can check against the original is a mark that quietly becomes wrong.
 *
 * Google is the one row whose server is not the vendor's: the tools come from
 * the operator's own Guaca account, which holds the grant. The mark is still
 * Google's, because what the crew reaches is Google.
 *
 * A server the operator added has no mark here and cannot: nobody knows what it
 * is, and an approximation would be a logo this file invented for somebody
 * else's software. It gets a plug instead, in the app's own accent, which says
 * the one true thing about it — that it is a server somebody plugged in.
 *
 * `nameFor` is the one thing here that a plugin *is*, and it is here because of
 * where it has to be read rather than what it is. Everything with a row under
 * it reads the name off that row, and still should. A transcript has no row: it
 * draws a call made a month ago, by a plugin this crew may have disconnected
 * since, and all the message carries is the prefix the tool was called by.
