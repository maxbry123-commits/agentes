/**
 * The cafeteria: agents that are already set up, waiting to be hired.
 *
 * Every field an operator would otherwise fill in by hand is written down here
 * once, well. The point is not that these are agents nobody could have written;
 * it is that writing twenty-one of them is an afternoon standing between a new
 * operator and a crew, and that afternoon buys nothing that a good default does
 * not.
 *
 * **What is stocked, and why these.** The counters are the departments of a
 * small software company, because a crew of agents is most often pointed at
 * one. The set is chosen so that a crew assembled from it can carry a change
 * the whole way without the operator writing a prompt: somebody decides what to
 * build, somebody draws it, somebody writes it, somebody reviews it, somebody
 * ships it and watches it, somebody documents it, and somebody tells the market
 * it exists. A gap in that chain is exactly the prompt the operator ends up
 * writing by hand, which is the work this file exists to remove. Which is why
 * design, reliability, security and growth are hires of their own rather than
 * duties folded into the engineer and the marketer: an agent doing five jobs
 * has no refusals, and the refusals are most of what a role is.
 *
 * The catalog cannot grow past the character cast, and that is the rule rather
 * than the coincidence it looks like. A crew is whatever subset was ticked, so
 * two presets sharing a character are two agents that look the same in one
 * rail. A new preset is a new row in `avatars/catalog.ts` first.
 *
 * **They are jobs, not functions.** "Chief of Staff" and "Paralegal", not
 * "Manager" and "Reviewer". A person staffing a workspace is thinking about a
 * role they would hire, and a role carries its own duties, its own judgment
 * and its own refusals: a paralegal declines to give a legal opinion, an
 * account manager does not promise a discount. A generic function label carries
 * none of that, and the operator has to supply all of it in the prompt, which
 * is the work this file exists to remove.
 *
 * A hire is a copy. Nothing here is referenced afterward: an agent hired from
 * the cafeteria is an ordinary agent with an ordinary card, editable, deletable
 * and indistinguishable from one typed out by hand. There is no upgrade path
 * from a preset to an agent because there is no link to upgrade along, which is
 * what stops this file from becoming a schema the database has to agree with.
 *
 * **House style for a prompt.** What the agent does, how it decides, and one
 * hard limit. The limit is the part that matters and the part that is easiest
 * to leave out: the cascade evals exist because a prompt with no stopping rule
 * makes a crew that talks to itself, and nothing in CI can see that. A preset
 * added without one is a regression that passes every automated suite. See
 * *Three test suites, asking different questions* in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
 * and run `./scripts/evals.sh` after touching anything below.
