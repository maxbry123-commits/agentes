/**
 * Every agent still in the workspace, in the order the operator arranged them.
 *
 * The arrangement and not the drawn order: this is one flat list across every
 * group, and where a row is lifted for working is a question about one section
 * of the rail. `lib/rail.ts` answers that, and the sidebar asks it per section.
 * A caller that just wants the roster, like the composer's mention list, gets
 * the arrangement, which is the order the operator would look for a name in.
 *
 * Memoized, and that is load-bearing rather than an optimization. `filter`
 * allocates a new array on every render, so an unmemoized result is a fresh
 * reference each time. Put that in a dependency list next to a `setState` and
 * you get effect -> render -> new reference -> effect, which React aborts by
 * unmounting the whole tree. The window paints its background and nothing else.
