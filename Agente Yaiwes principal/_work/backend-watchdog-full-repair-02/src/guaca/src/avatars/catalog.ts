/**
 * The cast.
 *
 * Five silhouettes, twenty-one characters. What tells two of them apart is,
 * first, which shape they are cut from, and then the resting lump on top of it:
 * how it leans, where its lobes are, and how its eyes are set. Nobody draws an
 * outline, so nobody can draw a bad one, and a new character is a row of
 * numbers rather than a path somebody has to get right.
 *
 * There was one shape before this and it was not enough. A rail of sixty round
 * creatures is a rail you read by color, because the only thing varying across
 * it was a few percent of stretch and where the eyes sat; the shape has to
 * carry some of the identity or the eyes carry all of it. So the outline is now
 * two decisions rather than one, and `silhouette.ts` holds the first.
 *
 * This replaced a cast of sixteen hand-drawn vegetables. The vegetables were
 * charming at six agents and childish at sixty, and every one of them was a
 * bezier somebody had to draw to a written spec that a test then had to check.
 * The spec is now the code: a character cannot leave its box, cannot sit at a
 * different weight, and cannot take light from a different direction, because
 * none of those are things a character supplies.
 *
 * Agents store the `key` and nothing else. No drawing is persisted, so any of
 * this can be redrawn without touching the database, and `ALIASES` keeps every
 * agent made by every earlier cast rendering as something deliberate.
