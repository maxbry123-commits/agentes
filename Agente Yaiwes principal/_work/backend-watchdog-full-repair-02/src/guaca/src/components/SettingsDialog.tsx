/**
 * Settings, as nine places rather than one scroll.
 *
 * Every piece of state lives here, in the shell, and the panes are given values
 * and setters. That is not tidiness: the shell is unmounted when the dialog
 * closes, so state held by a pane would be discarded every time the operator
 * changed section, and typing an endpoint, glancing at Limits and coming back
 * would silently lose the endpoint.
 *
 * Save stays in the foot, outside the scrolling half, for the same reason it
 * used to be at the bottom of one column: it acts on everything, not on the
 * section that happens to be open. It is drawn only while something is waiting
 * for it, which is what keeps that from being a lie. Five of the nine panes
 * stage nothing at all — Appearance and Notifications write as they are
 * clicked, Account acts at once, Shortcuts and About are read-only — so a Save
 * pinned there regardless spent most of its life offering to save settings that
 * were already saved, which reads as the opposite. Test is in the Provider pane
 * because it reads that pane and acts on none of the others, and it deliberately
 * sends what is on screen rather than what is stored. Save does not close.
