/**
 * An agent's browser, below its computer in the panel.
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as `ComputerScreen`: two sizes, one connection,
 * read-only behind a veil in the panel and interactive full screen. They are
 * different places and an operator has to be able to tell them apart at a
 * glance, but the way you watch one and take over is a thing worth learning
 * once.
 *
 * Taking over is not a nicety here, it is the only route in. Signing an agent
 * in is something only a person can do, and this frame is where they do it.
 *
 * There is no sleep button. A browser goes to standby seconds after the last
 * action, which keeps its state and stops the bill, and comes back the moment
 * anything drives it. Nothing about that is the operator's decision, so
 * offering it would be a switch that does nothing. Closing is offered, because
 * closing is what writes the cookies back to the profile: it is how a sign-in
 * just performed is made durable now rather than in an hour.
