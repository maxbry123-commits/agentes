/**
 * What an agent has, beside what it says.
 *
 * The transcript answers "what happened"; this answers "what is this agent set
 * up to do" — the machine it works on and the schedule it keeps. Both used to
 * be in the dialog you reached by right-clicking, which meant a standing
 * commitment and a live desktop were things you had to go and open a modal to
 * find, and could not watch while reading.
 *
 * Two levels, in the same column. The top one is the agent; opening a routine
 * replaces it rather than growing it, because a routine's instruction is
 * several sentences long and a list that showed it was one routine tall.
 *
 * The agent's name, look and instructions are deliberately not here. Those are
 * edited rarely and all at once, which is what a dialog is for; these are
 * glanced at constantly.
 *
 * The order is what is worth glancing at, most first. A screen is a picture of
 * something happening right now, so the two of them lead; then the schedule it
 * keeps, which is what is about to happen and is the one section nothing else
 * on screen says; then the working notes, which are what the agent is in the
 * middle of and which the transcript beside them is already showing. Memory is
 * last because it is the one section that is a text box: it is read closely
 * rather than glanced at, edited deliberately, and at the top it spent the
 * panel's vertical budget on a page nobody was looking at while the live
 * desktop under it sat below the fold. Its height cap stays for the same
 * reason it was added, one section further down.
 *
 * Memory and the working notes are the two halves of what an agent carries
 * between conversations, and they are the only sections with something to show
 * on every agent, since a screen is usually an offer rather than a picture and
 * a new agent keeps no routines. They are adjacent, which is what the schedule
 * moving above them buys: the two stores are read against each other, and what
 * each is for is clearest when the other is under it.
