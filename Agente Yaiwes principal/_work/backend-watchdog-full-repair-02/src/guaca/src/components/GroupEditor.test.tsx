/**
 * A group's settings, over a mocked runtime.
 *
 * Everything on this surface is an override, and the whole risk is in the draft
 * it sends rather than in the markup. A blank box means "inherit" and has to
 * arrive as null; a key nobody retyped has to be absent, because an empty one
 * clears the stored key; and a group following the app must not send a provider
 * at all. None of that is visible on screen, which is exactly why it is here.
 *
 * The other risk is the delete button, which is two different calls behind one
 * word. An empty group loses a row in a table; a group with a crew in it loses
 * four agents, their computers and their browsers, and none of that comes back.
