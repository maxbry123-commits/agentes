/**
 * What streaming costs the operator's window.

 * The report this exists for: five agents working at once and the app stops
 * responding, with their answers landing in one lump at the end instead of
 * arriving as they are written. Both are the same fault. The main thread never
 * gets far enough ahead to paint, so the text is there and nobody can see it.
 *
 * Counted rather than timed. A wall clock in a test on this machine says
 * nothing about that machine, but "one token re-rendered ninety messages" is
 * the same number everywhere.
