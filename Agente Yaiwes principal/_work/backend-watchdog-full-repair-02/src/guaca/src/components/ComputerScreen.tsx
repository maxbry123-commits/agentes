/**
 * An agent's computer, at the top of its panel.
 *
 * Two sizes, one connection. In the panel it is a live but read-only picture
 * behind a transparent veil, so a stray click cannot land in the agent's
 * desktop and the thing stays something you glance at while reading. Full
 * screen it accepts input and the operator can take over.
 *
 * Growing is a CSS change and nothing more: the frame keeps its place in the
 * tree and the stage around it is promoted to fill the window, so opening and
 * closing it never drops the desktop and reconnects to it.
 *
 * Two things make that change something to watch rather than something to
 * flinch at. The stage is not the element holding the screen's place in the
 * panel, so the panel does not reflow around the gap it leaves; and the stage
 * is played out of the picture it grew from rather than appearing at full size
 * in one frame, which is what made a change of size read as a reconnect.
 *
 * There is deliberately no terminal here. A shell is how the agent works, not
 * how an operator watches it, and a second way in only invited the two to
 * disagree about what was on the machine.
 *
 * It is also where an agent is given a computer and where it is taken back
 * again. That belongs beside the screen rather than in the profile dialog: the
 * decision is about a live, costed thing the operator can watch, and the
 * answer to "should this one have a machine" is usually being read off the
 * picture above the button.
