 * settings, down to the `aria-pressed` and the label that names what is being
 * chosen. One the operator does not have is drawn and disabled with the command
 * that installs it, rather than hidden: the state this control exists for is a
 * plan that has just run out, and an absent option reads as a thing the app
 * cannot do.
 *
 * On an existing repository the click *is* the change, which is what a `.choice`
 * means everywhere else in this app and is why the caller writes it through
 * rather than staging it beside the name and the note. Staged, it sits under a
 * Save button that an operator has every reason to press before they get to it,
 * and the whole change is lost with nothing on screen saying so. On the link
 * form there is no row to write to yet, so there it rides on the draft.

/**
 * The directories a crew may write code in, and who in it may.
 *
 * ## There is no engineer here, and that is the point
 *
 * The obvious control is a switch on an agent that says it is an engineer, or a
 * specialist, or whatever the tier gets called. It is not here, because a tier
 * carries no information this list does not. An agent with no repository is
 * offered nothing that reaches a working tree; an "engineer" with no repository
 * is the same agent with a badge. Two answers to one question is two places for
 * it to be wrong, and only one of them is the one the runtime reads.
 *
 * The part a tier feels like it would buy is already content and already ships.
 * The cafeteria hires a Software Engineer, a Code Reviewer and a QA Tester,
 * each with its own brief, and the model field suggests programming models for
 * an agent whose words read that way. Designating an engineer is hiring one and
 * giving it a directory. Nothing under here has to know the word.
 *
 * ## Linking is here; handing out is on the agent
 *
 * Two decisions, and they are split across two panels rather than stacked in
 * one, because they are asked at different moments. "What codebases does this
 * crew have" is a crew fact, set up once and edited when a directory moves.
 * "What can this agent work on" is asked every time somebody hires an engineer,
 * and it is answered where an agent is decided, beside its model and its
 * instructions. `AgentRepositories` is that panel.
 *
 * A newly linked repository therefore reaches nobody, and the line under each
 * row says so. That is a state to pass through rather than one to hide: a
 * crew's source handed to every agent at the moment it was linked is the
 * accident this feature most has to avoid.
 *
 * Who has what stays here as a read, and only as a read. Auditing is a real
 * question, and answering it should not mean opening six agents one at a time.
 * The same reason the plugin panel says who a sign-in is offered to.
 *
 * There is no "every agent" button here and there is one on the plugins panel.
 * An agent hired next week must not inherit the operator's own source. Names,
 * always, and only on the agent.
 *
 * The heading and the sentence explaining all of that are the section's, not
 * this panel's. It has a section of its own in the group editor rather than a
 * third block under Plugins, so drawing its own title under the section's would
 * be the same word twice at two sizes.
 *
 * ## Why the harness is a choice on the row and not a setting
 *
 * Because a subscription is spent by the program it was issued to. An operator
 * whose ChatGPT plan is spent cannot be helped by configuring `pi`: they need
 * Claude Code, which is a different program with a different sign-in. So the
 * choice is between programs, it sits beside the note because it is the same
 * kind of fact about how work happens in this directory, and one codebase can
 * answer it differently from the next.
 *
 * The one it offers that is not installed is offered anyway, disabled, with the
 * command that installs it underneath. Hiding it makes an operator whose plan
 * has just run out conclude the app cannot do the thing it can do, and enabling
 * it stores a choice whose only symptom is a coding job that never starts,
 * reported to an agent forty minutes later.
