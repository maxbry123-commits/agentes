/**
 * What a vendor's answer looks like by the time a model reads it.
 *
 * Separated from the protocol so it can be asserted without a server to talk to. The case worth
 * having tests for is the empty one: a tool that matched nothing used to hand back an empty string,
 * and an empty string is the single most dangerous thing to put in front of a model. It reads as
 * "the tool had nothing to say" rather than "there is nothing there", and the model fills the gap
 * from memory — which is exactly the answer with nothing behind it that a knowledge connector must
 * never give.
