# OpenBot, whole, in one container.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. Everything a laptop runs, minus the database, in one image on one port. Deploy it
# anywhere that runs a container and you get what `scripts/start.sh` gives you locally: the app, the
# API, and a browser the Bots can drive.
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY.
#
#   PostgreSQL. A container filesystem does not survive a redeploy and the audit trail is the
#   product. `DATABASE_URL` points at a managed instance, which is one click on every platform this
#   is meant to run on.
#
#   The supervisor. It exists to give each Bot its own container, which needs a Docker socket, which
#   no serverless container platform permits. Without it every Bot shares the browser below, exactly
#   as they do on a laptop with no supervisor configured. Per-Bot isolation is A6.
#
# THE BASE IS PLAYWRIGHT'S, not Bun's, because Chromium and its system libraries have to stay
# matched and that image is the only place that is guaranteed. The tag must move with the
# `playwright` dependency in `agent-computer/package.json`. Bump both or neither.

# A Bot can install what a task needs, and nothing else as root.
#
# `sudo` without a password, because a package manager that cannot install is not one, and "install a
# tool then use it" is the whole point of giving a Bot a shell.
#
# THE PACKAGE MANAGERS, NOT ALL. This was `NOPASSWD: ALL`, and the comment below it explained what
# that cost: a Bot could become root inside its container. It then named the two conditions that make
# that acceptable — the container being one Bot's alone, and not holding a database — and this image
# meets neither. The supervisor is deliberately not in it, so every Bot shares one computer, and
# `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` is a documented way to run it. So root here read another Bot's workspace, the
# API's environment, and the audit database that records what it did.
#
# Naming the commands keeps the feature and removes that. `apt-get install` still works, which is what
# the tool description tells a model to run. `sudo cat /proc/1/environ` does not.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is a floor, not a boundary. Root is one CVE away and a shared container is not
# an isolation story for code a model wrote: that needs a computer per Bot and a sandbox under it,
# which is why per-Bot computers and gVisor are not optional extras next to this feature. Run the
# image with `--security-opt no-new-privileges` where the platform allows, which turns setuid off
# entirely for anything not named here.

# backwards: a Bot being able to open a shell and install what a task needs is a requested feature,
# not an oversight. Removing them hardens the image by deleting the product.
#
# What makes that safe is not their absence. It is that a Bot reaches them the same way it reaches
# anything else, through the gateway: resolve, decide against the policy, write the audit row, then
# act. A command is a decision like a click is.

# the audit trail.
#
# This matters more than usual here. Chromium is launched with `--no-sandbox` unless the host can
# support its sandbox, and with that flag the process user IS the boundary, so root would mean a
# page exploit lands as root.
#
# The two directories the browser writes are its workspace and its profile, the second being what
