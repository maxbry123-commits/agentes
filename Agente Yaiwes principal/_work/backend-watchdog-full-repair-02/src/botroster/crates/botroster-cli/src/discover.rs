//! Finding a model that is already on this machine, without being told.
//!
//! The first thing a new person met used to be a refusal:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: no model configured.
//! Set one once:  botroster config set --model grok-4-5
//! ```
//!
//! which is an instruction to go and get an account somewhere, come back, and
//! type a command with four flags. Meanwhile a great many of the people who
//! would try this already have Ollama or LM Studio running, with a model
//! downloaded, on a port this process can reach in under a second. Asking them
//! to configure what is already there is asking them to do the computer's job.
//!
//! Nothing here is a fallback in the sense of "second best". A local model on
//! localhost needs no account, no key, and sends nothing off the machine, which
//! is the arrangement this project's whole position argues for.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not go looking on the network. Every address probed is loopback, and
//! that is not a performance decision: a tool that scans for open ports on the
//! machines around it is doing something its user did not ask for and would not
//! like, whatever it finds.
