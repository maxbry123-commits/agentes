//! Tests that drive the shipped binary.
//!
//! Most other tests call library code, and a command can break in ways no
//! library test can see: a relative browser profile path, a tool count in the
//! README that nothing checks. These tests run the real executable from a
//! clean directory, the way a person would. `CARGO_BIN_EXE_botroster` is the
//! binary cargo just built, so this cannot drift from what ships.
//!
//! Commands needing a live hub are in `cli_live.rs`; these are the ones that
//! only touch local state, which is most of them.

/// be absent"* — and it is not an exotic situation for a person developing
/// this product.

/// Swept across the commands rather than asserted on one, because that is the
