//! The reference ACP SDK driving `botroster acp` as a real client would.
//!
//! `acp_live.rs` hand-rolls JSON-RPC bytes to test the agent, and the SDK's
//! own tests speak to fake lines. Neither proves that the actual client
//! library, the one the desktop client is built on, can negotiate with the
//! actual server. Every ACP feature the desktop client shows a person (a
//! session that lives, a turn that streams, a stop reason that means
//! something) crosses this join, so the join is tested here, on this binary,
//! through this SDK.
