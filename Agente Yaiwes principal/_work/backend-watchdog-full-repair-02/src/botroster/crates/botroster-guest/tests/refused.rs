//! What a guest does when the hub refuses it.
//!
//! Upgrading a hub underneath a running guest is the ordinary operational
//! sequence the reconnect logic exists to survive. If the upgraded hub refuses
//! the guest's protocol version, two properties matter:
//!
//! * The hub's refusal says exactly what is wrong, and the guest must pass
//!   that on. Parsing the reply as a `HelloAck` fails on a missing field, and
//!   reporting that instead would surface a version mismatch as
//!   `missing field \`connection_id\``, which names neither version nor any
//!   way to fix it.
//! * Retrying is right for an outage and wrong for a refusal. Waiting does not
//!   change a protocol version, and meanwhile `botroster status` reports no
//!   computer attached while the guest is silently turned away every thirty
//!   seconds.
//!
//! The fake hub below covers both: it accepts once so the guest gets past its
//! first connection, then refuses everything after.
