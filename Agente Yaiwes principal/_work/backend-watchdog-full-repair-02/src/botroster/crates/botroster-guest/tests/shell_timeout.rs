//! What a timed-out `shell.exec` leaves behind.
//!
//! `shell.exec` is the most powerful tool the guest offers, and a timeout is
//! the normal way a bad command ends. If the process survives the timeout, the
//! model is told "timed out" while the command keeps running: still writing
//! files, still holding the workspace. An agent that retries then stacks
//! orphans.
//!
//! Detected by side effect rather than by process introspection: the command
//! sleeps, then writes a marker. If the marker ever appears, the command
//! outlived the call that gave up on it.
