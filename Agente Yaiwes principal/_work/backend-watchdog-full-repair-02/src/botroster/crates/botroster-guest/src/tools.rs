//! The guest's tool implementations, and the workspace confinement they run
//! under.
//!
//! Confinement is the security-critical part of this file. The guest backs a
//! remote workspace shared by every Bot on one account, so a path escape is a
//! tenant boundary violation. Resolution rejects `..` traversal, absolute
//! paths outside the root, and symlinks that point out, and it is enforced on
//! the canonicalised path, because a check on the lexical path is defeated by
//! any symlink.
//!
//! Dangling symlinks need particular care: `exists()` follows links, so a
//! broken link looks like a name that is not there, and writing through it
//! would create the target outside the workspace. The ancestor walk in
//! [`Workspace::resolve`] therefore stops on the directory entry
//! (`symlink_metadata`), so a broken link is found and refused.
//!
//! This matters beyond `fs.write`: `browser.screenshot` takes a
//! caller-supplied path and is `allow` in the shipped default policy, since a
//! screenshot is pixels of a page the agent already opened. Through a broken
//! link it would be an unapproved write to an arbitrary location. The
//! workspace is durable and shared between Bots, so a link only has to arrive
//! once.
