//! A real browser in the guest, driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
//!
//! Most systems that need automating have no clean API, so the agent works the
//! website the way a person does.
//!
//! # Why hand-rolled
//!
//! CDP is JSON-RPC over a WebSocket, which this codebase already speaks. A
//! browser-automation crate would bring a large dependency tree to wrap a
//! protocol of which only a handful of methods are needed. The whole client
//! is in this file.
//!
//! # The profile lives in the durable volume
//!
//! Chrome is launched against a `user-data-dir` inside the workspace's volume,
//! so cookies and signed-in sessions survive the guest being rebuilt. "Sign in
//! once" is not a browser feature; it is a consequence of putting the profile
//! somewhere durable.
