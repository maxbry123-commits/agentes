//! Durable state for a computer.
//!
//! The guest can be rebuilt, replaced, or rolled back, and the user's work
//! has to survive all three. This crate owns that state independently of what
//! will run the guest (a container or a microVM) once one exists; today it is
//! an ordinary process.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! <root>/volumes/<id>/
//!   meta.json           sequence counter + snapshot index
//!   current/            live data; this is what the guest mounts as /workspace
//!   blobs/<ab>/<hash>   content-addressed file bodies, shared across snapshots
//!   manifests/<sid>.json  path -> hash for one point in time
//!   current.new/        only present mid-restore (see Crash safety)
//! ```
//!
//! # Snapshots are content-addressed
//!
//! Hard links are not used. A hard link is a second name for the same inode,
//! so a linked snapshot only preserves history if every writer replaces files
//! rather than modifying them. Editors that write-to-temp-and-rename do
//! replace; `fs::write`, a shell `>` redirect, an append, and most programs
//! writing a file they already opened do not. They truncate in place, and
//! every snapshot pointing at that inode silently changes with it. This
//! property is held by `a_snapshot_is_immutable_once_taken`.
//!
//! Instead, each file is hashed and its bytes are copied into a
//! content-addressed blob store keyed by that hash. Identical content is
//! stored once however many snapshots reference it, so the first snapshot pays
//! a full copy and later ones pay only for what changed. A blob cannot be
//! mutated through the live tree, because nothing in the live tree shares its
//! inode.
//!
//! # Crash safety
//!
//! Restore never mutates `current` in place. It builds `current.new`, then
//! swaps. If the process dies mid-swap, [`Volume::open`] finishes it on the
//! next start rather than leaving a half-restored workspace.
