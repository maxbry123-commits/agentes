//! The BOTROSTER shell's command layer, driven the way the window drives it.
//!
//! `tauri::test`'s mock runtime builds the same commands the binary ships and
//! invokes them over the same IPC path, with no window, so this is the
//! shipped shell talking to a shipped `botroster`, with a real hub and guest
//! underneath. The engine below is covered by its own tests and `main.rs`
//! above is not reachable from a test binary; this file covers the command
//! layer between them.

// The same harness the engine's tests use, included rather than copied.
// `botroster-cli` and `botroster` already keep one copy each because test support
// cannot cross package boundaries; a third would be a third thing to keep in
// step. botroster-app depends on botroster already, so the coupling is not new.
