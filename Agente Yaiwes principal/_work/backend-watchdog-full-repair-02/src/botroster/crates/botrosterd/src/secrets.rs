//! Credentials, held by the control plane and never given to the guest.
//!
//! This is the security core of the design, and it rests on one invariant:
//!
//! > A connector's token never leaves this process. The guest asks the hub to
//! > call a tool; the hub makes the outbound request with the credential
//! > attached. The guest, a process running model-directed code that is
//! > reachable by prompt injection from any page it visits, is never given the
//! > token.
//!
//! # Redaction is a type, not a discipline
//!
//! Secrets rarely leak through a deliberate `println!("{token}")`. They leak
//! when a struct holding one derives `Debug` and is later included in an
//! error, a log line, a panic message, or a serialised event. So [`Secret`]
//! refuses to render itself: its `Debug` and `Display` print `[redacted]`,
//! and it has no `Serialize` at all. Getting the bytes out requires calling
//! [`Secret::expose`], which is greppable and rare.
