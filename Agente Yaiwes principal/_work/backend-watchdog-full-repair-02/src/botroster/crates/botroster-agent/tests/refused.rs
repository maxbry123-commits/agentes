//! What a person sees when the hub turns their client away.
//!
//! The hub answers a handshake it will not accept with an `RpcError` that says
//! precisely what is wrong ("unsupported protocol_version …"). A client that
//! parses that reply as a `HelloAck` hits a missing field and reports the
//! parse failure instead:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: handshake: missing field `connection_id` at line 1 column 89
//! ```
//!
//! which names no version, no mismatch and no fix, while the hub's own
//! sentence sits unused in the payload. These tests hold that the refusal is
//! surfaced verbatim.
