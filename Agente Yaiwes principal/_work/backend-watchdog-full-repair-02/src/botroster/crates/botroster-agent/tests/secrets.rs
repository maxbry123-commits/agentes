//! A credential a Bot asked for reaches the store and nowhere else.
//!
//! The promise is that a supplied credential is masked, absent from the
//! transcript, and never shown to the model. Two other tests cover parts of
//! it: `botrosterd`'s `a_supplied_credential_is_stored_and_never_returned` checks
//! the tool result, and `botroster-cli`'s checks that no unattended approval mode
//! supplies a value. Neither exercises the middle: `HubClient`'s
//! `Method::SecretRequest` arm, the code that routes the ask to a person and
//! puts the answer back on the wire. And "absent from the tool result" does
//! not imply "absent from everything a running turn writes down".
//!
//! This test drives the real path (real hub, real `HubClient`, real agent
//! loop) with a sentinel value, then searches for the sentinel in three
//! places: `outcome.transcript`, which is verbatim what `botroster-cli` appends to
//! `conversation.jsonl`; every `AgentEvent` a client renders; and every byte
//! the hub wrote under the home.
//!
//! The conversation log is written a crate later, by `botroster-cli`, so it does
//! not exist under this home and the file sweep does not cover it; the sweep
//! covers what the hub wrote. The transcript is therefore checked from the
//! value `botroster-cli` persists rather than from a file this test never causes
//! to exist.
