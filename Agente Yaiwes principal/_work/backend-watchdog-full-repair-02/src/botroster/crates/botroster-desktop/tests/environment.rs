//! What the shell that launched the window can still decide for a Bot.
//!
//! The window spawns `botroster acp` for every Bot, and the agent-client-protocol
//! SDK offers no `env_remove` (only additive `env(name, value)`), so that
//! child inherits the window's whole environment. Every `BOTROSTER_*` variable the
//! CLI reads is therefore a channel from the shell that started the app into a
//! Bot's model connection, and the window closes exactly two of them: it sets
//! `BOTROSTER_HUB_URL` explicitly and passes `--home`.
//!
//! Both of those rest on one assumption, that a flag beats the environment.
//! That is clap's behaviour, not this codebase's. `config.rs` proves that
//! flags override the file, but it builds `ModelOverrides` by hand; that an
//! environment variable becomes such a flag is `main.rs`'s `env = "..."`
//! wiring, and these tests join the two.
//!
//! These read the shipped binary, because that is the only thing that can
//! answer either question.
