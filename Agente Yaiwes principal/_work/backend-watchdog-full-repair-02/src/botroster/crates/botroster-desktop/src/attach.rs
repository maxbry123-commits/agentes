//! Copying a local file to where a Bot can read it.
//!
//! The guest is jailed to its workspace: `Workspace::resolve` refuses any path
//! that escapes the root, so a file outside it is not readable by a Bot no
//! matter how a prompt describes it. Attaching a file means copying it in
//! first; this module is the client's half of that.
//!
//! # Why a path and not the bytes
//!
//! ACP supports sending file contents in the prompt as an embedded resource,
//! which needs no workspace at all. That is the wrong choice here for two
//! reasons:
//!
//! * The transcript replays. The task becomes the user turn, is written to
//!   `conversation.jsonl`, and `run_task` seeds every following turn with the
//!   last `history` messages (40 by default). A file sent inline is re-sent to
//!   the model on every turn until it falls out of that window. A size cap only
//!   chooses how much gets re-sent.
//! * It would bypass the policy gate. Contents in a prompt reach the model with
//!   no tool call to evaluate, so an operator who denied `fs.read` would still
//!   have files read to their Bot. Enforcement lives in the hub (SPEC §6.0),
//!   and a client that puts file contents in front of a model without a tool
//!   call has moved it.
//!
//! So the file is copied in and the prompt carries a path. The Bot reads it
//! with `fs.read` if it wants it: once, and gated.
