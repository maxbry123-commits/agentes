/// crates that never link against each other (`botroster acp` is a separate
/// process the client spawns). Two independent declarations, one per side,
/// would compile and pass every test on both sides, then silently diverge the
/// moment either was renamed: the agent would tag a request the client no
/// longer recognised, the client would render an ordinary approval whose
/// "Provide credential" button supplies nothing, and the Bot would be refused.
