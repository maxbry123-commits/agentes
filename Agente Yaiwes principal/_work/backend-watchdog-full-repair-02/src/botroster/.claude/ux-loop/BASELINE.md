# BASELINE — iteration 000, current `main`

Measured 2026-08-20 ~04:12 on branch `ux/overnight-2026-08-20`, before any UX change.
Shots: `.claude/ux-loop/shots/000/` (48 files, gitignored).

## Gate numbers

| Gate | Baseline |
|---|---|
| `cargo check` (botroster-app, botroster-desktop) | pass |
| `cargo clippy -D warnings` | pass |
| `cargo fmt --check` | pass |
| `cargo test -p botroster-app --test page` | **57 passed** |
| axe serious | **4** |
| axe critical | **2** |
| contrast failures | **2** |
| worst contrast | **2.79:1** (needs 4.5) |
| keyboard unreachable | 0 |
| reduced-motion violations | 0 |
| bundle | **135,667 bytes** (ceiling 156,017) |
| shot run | 4.0s for 48 shots |
| full gate run | ~8 min cold |

**The baseline does not pass its own gates.** Six of the eight failures are real defects in
the shipped product, not harness artefacts:

1. **`span.step-state` "running" — 2.95:1 dark, 2.79:1 light.** The word that tells you a
   tool step is in flight is the least legible text on the screen. Directly against rubric 4.
2. **`scrollable-region-focusable` (s08, s10, both themes).** The thread log scrolls but is
   not keyboard-focusable, so a keyboard user cannot scroll back through a 200-step run.
   Directly against rubric 9.
3. **`select-name` (s12, both themes) — critical.** A `<select>` in the rules/wiring panel
   has no accessible name.

These are the first three items the loop should clear, because until they are fixed no other
change can commit — a gate failure reverts the whole iteration.

## Rubric at 000

Scored from `shots/000/`. Lines 6, 11 and 15 describe surfaces that do not exist; they score
0 rather than N/A, per RUBRIC.md.

| # | Line | Score | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | cold start unambiguous | 2 | `s01` names the product, explains the runtime, one primary Connect. Three path fields shown before any of them is needed. |
| 2 | four roster statuses in <1s | **0** | `s04`: no status exists. Four identical rows. |
| 3 | one loudest element per screen | 1 | `s06`: the loudest thing is "Allow once" — the consequential action. `s04`: the loudest thing is the empty-state paragraph. |
| 4 | doing-now vs already-did | 2 | `s05` distinguishes them with a spinner mark and a tick, but "running" is the lowest-contrast text on screen. |
| 5 | steps state their target | **3** | `s05`: "Listed the workspace · 3 entries", "Read applications/2026-08.jsonl · 120 characters". Already right. |
| 6 | computer visible without interaction | **0** | Behind a top-right button; pane is `hidden`. |
| 7 | approval: safe choice louder | **0** | `s06`: "Allow once" is the filled primary. |
| 8 | denial reads as final | 2 | `s07` renders the refusal as a result row with prose; no control implies appeal. |
| 9 | find last approval in 200 steps | **0** | `s08`: no marker, no jump, no count. |
| 10 | which Bot produced which step | 1 | `s09`: a coat hairline, but two coats are near-identical orange. |
| 11 | takeover obvious | **0** | No window-side takeover surface exists. |
| 12 | failure names cause + one action | 1 | `s11`: the banner names the cause; the action offered is "Dismiss". |
| 13 | three routine states | **0** | Only two are expressible. |
| 14 | empty state is a path | 1 | `s04` right pane: good copy, no action. |
| 15 | provenance trail | **0** | Does not exist. |
| 16 | light equal to dark | 2 | Both themed through `light-dark()`; light is a real design, not an inversion. Same defects in both. |
| 17 | nothing looks library-default | 2 | Hand-built; the purple primary pill is the most generic element. |
| 18 | amber only where a human blocks | 3 | No stray amber. (Inverted line: no = 3.) |
| 19 | recognisable as the reference | 3 | No. (Inverted line: no = 3.) |
| 20 | Chanel test | 1 | `s04`: remove the "connected" pill. `s06`: remove the "Edit" link beside the Bot name. Both screens have a removable element, which means neither is finished. |

**Total: 24 / 60.**

Weakest cluster: everything DIRECTION calls the product's argument — the computer pane (6),
the provenance trail (15), takeover (11), roster status (2) — scores zero. The thread log
(5) is the one line that already scores full marks and should not be touched.

# Bundle baseline re-cuts

`.claude/ux-loop/.baseline-bytes` is **gitignored**, so the number itself leaves no trace in
review. This is where a re-cut is recorded, because a growth gate whose reference point moved
silently is not a gate.

The gate measures `ui/index.html + ui/main.js + ui/styles.css` (plus `ui/fonts/` when it
exists — it does not yet) and fails at **+15%** over the baseline.

| Date | Old | New | Growth absorbed | New ceiling | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-20 | 135,667 | **154,229** | +18,562 (13.7%) | 177,363 | Two surfaces landed deliberately and the old floor predated both of them |

## What went into the 18,562 bytes

Measured per commit, not estimated — `git show <rev>:ui/*` summed at each one:

| Commit | Bytes | What |
|---|---|---|
| `9d9f13f` | **+7,015** | the Model section on the connect panel (B18) and the shared problem banner (B15) |
| `8286b2d` | **+6,073** | structured connect error, fault table, demo offer (B12) |
| `bfdc79a` | **+1,841** | abandoned-step rendering (B14) |
| `12e3b21` | +1,263 | the empty conversation offers the way out of itself |
| `53c6bde` | +1,098 | step-state legibility, log reachability, select naming |
| `f726bf5` | +748 | transport pill quiet, working state off amber |
| `ae0c5f3` | +524 | `--coat-4` off amber |
| `3665cb8` | 0 | Rust only — the engine change touched no `ui/` file |
| | **+18,562** | |

`9d9f13f` is not split between B18 and B15 because they landed in one commit; splitting the
byte count afterwards would be a guess presented as a measurement.

None of it is dependency weight: there are no dependencies. `ui/` is still three
hand-written files with no bundler, no framework and no npm, which is a documented property
of this repo and the reason these numbers are readable at all.

## Why re-cut rather than trim

The old baseline was measured on `main` before any of this existed, so by the end it was
holding two requested features against a floor cut before either was written. At 154,229 of
a 156,017 ceiling there were 1,788 bytes left — the next legitimate change would have been
reverted by the gate for being the straw, not for being wrong.

The gate's purpose is catching growth nobody decided on. Re-cutting after a decided change is
the gate working; trimming a surface to fit a stale number would have been the gate working
the product.

## A weakness worth knowing

`.baseline-bytes` is gitignored, and `ux-verify.sh` writes it on first run when absent. So on
a fresh clone the first gate run records whatever it finds and **cannot fail**, and every
machine carries its own reference point. That is fine for a growth detector used by one
person on one checkout, and wrong for anything shared: two machines can hold different
baselines and disagree about whether the same change passes.

Tracking the file instead would fix both — re-cuts would show up in a diff, and every clone
would measure against the same number. That changes the harness contract, so it is left as a
recommendation rather than done here.

## Baseline re-cut, 2026-08-25 — implementing DIRECTION.md

`154,229` became `179,475`. The ceiling was 15% over the old number and this work went through
it, which is what the ceiling is for: it caught the growth and made it a decision instead of a
drift.

**Why it was allowed to grow.** The old baseline was measured against a token layer DIRECTION.md
had already replaced on paper and never in the file. Implementing it is not the loop bloating the
client with new features; it is the client finally carrying the system it was specified to have.
The growth is one `:root` block: pinned tokens, the derived surface steps, the status fills, the
radius scale and the coats, each with the reason next to it. `REDESIGN.md` §3 planned this and
said it should happen once, deliberately, in its own commit.

**What did not change.** The rule that the number is a ceiling, not a target. Re-cutting is a
thing that happens when a phase is specified to add weight, and not a thing that happens because
a phase overran. Phases 1 through 6 in `REDESIGN.md` are expected to fit under the new 15%;
if one of them does not, that is a finding about the phase, not a reason to move the line again.

## What the gate measures changed, 2026-08-25 — gzipped, not raw

Phase 3's last item went through the ceiling by **610 bytes** (207,006 against 206,396). The
previous entry says what should happen then: *"if one of them does not fit, that is a finding
about the phase, not a reason to move the line again."* So the phase was measured rather than
the line moved, and the measurement said the line was wrong.

| | bytes | comments | share |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | 31,191 | 11,315 | 36% |
| `main.js` | 125,153 | 65,202 | **52%** |
| `styles.css` | 44,877 | 14,718 | 33% |
| **total** | **207,006** | **91,235** | **44%** |

`CONTRIBUTING.md` requires comments that say what broke and why; `CLAUDE.md` says the reason goes
next to the thing. There is no build step, so those comments ship. A raw-byte ceiling on a file
that ships its comments is therefore, in practice, **a limit on how much of the reasoning
survives** — and the two rules were pulling against each other with only one of them measured.

**The gate now measures the gzipped size of the three files.** Gzip is what a person actually
waits for, it discounts repeated prose by roughly ten to one, and it counts novel code close to
full — which is the growth the ceiling was put there to watch. One line of `ux-verify.sh`, no
minifier, no parser. Vendored fonts are still counted raw: WOFF2 is already compressed, and
gzipping it again would measure the compressor rather than the font.

`179,475` raw becomes **`61,468` gzipped**, with a ceiling of `70,688`. The number is the last
commit before the phase that hit the limit, deliberately: baselining at the current working tree
would have granted this commit the exemption that started the conversation.

**The baseline file is named for its unit.** `.baseline-bytes` is gitignored, so every machine
that ran the old gate still has one holding a raw number. Read as a compressed one it puts the
ceiling at three times the real size and passes everything, forever — a gate that has quietly
stopped gating, which is worse than one that fails. The new gate reads `.baseline-gzip-bytes`,
so the old file is simply not its file and the baseline is recorded on first run.

**Decided by the operator, not by the loop.** A gate that the thing being gated may redefine is
not a gate, and this is the one change in this file a loop must not make on its own. It was put
as a question with the measurements above, and this was the answer.

**What did not change.** Everything else. The number is a ceiling and not a target; 15% is still
the allowance; re-cutting still happens only when a phase is specified to add weight. Phases 4
through 6 are expected to fit under the new ceiling, and the raw number remains worth glancing at
— it is just no longer the thing that fails a build.
