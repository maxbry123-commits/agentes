"""
CommandGateway - context-aware rehydration + exfiltration control.

The gateway sits between the LLM and local execution. It:
  * receives an LLM-generated raw command or a structured tool call,
  * detects placeholders and validates they are allowed *in that position*,
  * rehydrates placeholders only in approved argument positions,
  * withholds the real value where the position is an exfiltration sink,
  * hands back a real command for local execution,
  * re-sanitizes stdout/stderr before results go back to the LLM.

Rehydration is deliberately NOT a naive global string replace: a placeholder is
only turned back into its real value after the surrounding shell context has
been proven safe, and only for placeholder tokens known to the session vault.

Policy: degrade, do not deny
---------------------------
Widening the default protection boundary to URL/DOMAIN/PATH (issue #40, merged
as PR #41) meant that essentially *every* pentest command now carries a
placeholder, so every exfiltration rule started firing on legitimate work and
the gateway became a campaign-stopper: 9 of 15 ordinary commands were refused,
and a URL containing `?` could not be rehydrated at all because the injection
guard rejected the metacharacter (PR #42).

Blocking was never the thing protecting the operator. Two things are:
  1. the model only ever receives placeholders, and
  2. every byte of tool output is re-tokenized before the model sees it.

So the gateway no longer refuses a command. When a placeholder sits in a
position that would hand its real value to a third party, the command is
executed with that *placeholder left in place* - the third party receives the
meaningless token `IP_PRIVATE_001`, the command still runs, and the campaign
continues. That is `GatewayPolicy.DEGRADE`, the default.

`GatewayPolicy.STRICT` keeps the previous refuse-outright behaviour for
operators who want it (`DARKMOON_PRIVACY_POLICY=strict`).
