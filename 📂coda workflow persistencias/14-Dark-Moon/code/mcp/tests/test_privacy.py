"""
Tests for the Darkmoon privacy gateway (PrivacyVault + CommandGateway).

Proves the seven required properties:
  1. the LLM never receives the real IP
  2. the same real IP always maps to the same placeholder within a session
  3. commands using placeholders are correctly executed locally (rehydrated)
  4. raw stdout/stderr is sanitized before returning to the LLM
  5. unsafe exfiltration commands are blocked
  6. placeholders cannot be resolved directly by the LLM
  7. secrets are never restored, even locally, unless explicitly configured for
     a safe local-only report path
