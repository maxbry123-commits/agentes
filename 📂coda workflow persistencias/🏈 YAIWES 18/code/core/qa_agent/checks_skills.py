QA agent — mandatory skill-chain checks.

Enforce the universal progression (spider → /web-exploit → /param-fuzz →
/business-logic) and flag endpoint types whose required skill was never
invoked. Directives are injected one at a time — later chain steps hold off
while an earlier step's directive is still pending.
