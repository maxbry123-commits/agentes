QA Agent — depth enforcer
=========================
Depth-enforcement daemon. Runs every 2 minutes during an active scan.

Focus: push Smith to go deeper, not cut corners, and complete full scan cycles.
Not concerned with PoC files, coverage bookkeeping, scope housekeeping, or gate timers.

Two responsibilities:
1. Alert generation — coded alerts written to qa_state.json and surfaced in envelopes.
2. Steering directives — written to steering_queue.json, injected into Smith's next
   tool response automatically. One directive at a time — never pile on.

Alert schema
  {
    "code":     str,   — machine-readable code
    "urgency":  str,   — "high" | "medium" | "low"
    "blocking": bool,  — true = blocks scan completion
    "message":  str,   — human-readable description
  }

Checks kept:
  BULK_MARKING         — >10 N/A cells with no tested_by tool (blocking anti-shortcut)
  COVERAGE_INTEGRITY   — tested/vulnerable cells missing tested_by tool (blocking anti-shortcut)
  SUSPICIOUS_SPEED     — >20 cells closed in <10 min (shortcut detection)
  NA_ABUSE             — N/A rate >35% of addressed cells (shortcut detection)
  DEPTH_AFTER_FINDING  — high/critical finding >20 min old with no follow-up tools
  WHITEBOX_PASSES      — thorough scan with <3 semgrep passes (3-pass enforcement)
  PREMATURE_COMPLETE   — complete called before 3-pass requirement met
  TOOL_INACTIVITY      — no tool activity for >15 min (stall detection)
  NO_SPIDER            — httpx ran but spider never did (mandatory tool chain)
  MISSING_SKILL        — endpoint type discovered but required skill never invoked

Layout
------
The implementation is split across focused submodules; import from
``core.qa_agent`` exactly as before — every name is re-exported here.

  __init__         this file — paths, HIR dedup state, _has_pending_directives, facade
  _util            pure helpers (_ts_age_secs)
  hir              the _hir() Human-Intervention trigger
  checks_shortcuts anti-shortcut checks (bulk N/A, integrity, speed, N/A abuse)
  checks_depth     depth/stall checks + stuck-on-target HIR escalation
  checks_skills    mandatory skill-chain + missing-skill checks
  checks_health    auth/budget/reachability/tool-failure HIR checks
  daemon           _deterministic_qa_checks orchestrator + QADaemon

Paths and _last_hir_trigger_ts live here in the package namespace so they stay
patchable as ``core.qa_agent.NAME`` (the test suite patches _STEERING_FILE,
_SESSION_FILE, _last_hir_trigger_ts, etc.). Submodules read them back via
``import core.qa_agent as _qa``.
