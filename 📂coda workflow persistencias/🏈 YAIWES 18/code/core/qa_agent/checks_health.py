QA agent — scan-health checks that escalate to HIR.

Conditions Smith cannot self-resolve: expired auth, exhausted budget with low
coverage, an empty matrix after a 0-endpoint spider, an unreachable target,

exception is ``_check_exploit_escalation`` — benchmark-mode only, which pushes
exploitation via a steering directive instead of pausing.
