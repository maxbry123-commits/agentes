"""
Hung / stalled / exited Smith detection and the kill primitive.

Distinguishes the three failure shapes the watchdog must treat differently:
alive-but-stuck (hung), alive-but-loop-exited (stalled), and cleanly-gone
(exited). Sibling signal helpers are reached through the package object
(``_smith.<name>``) so patches on ``core.api_server.smith.<name>`` are observed;
pid lookups and paths stay on the parent (``_api.<name>``).

      • no MCP heartbeat in the last ``_SMITH_IDLE_SECONDS`` seconds AND
        the session is past its startup grace window.

    The fresh-quick-log / startup-grace short-circuits prevent us from

    hung. Without them, normal slow tool calls would trigger respawn.

    The hang-vs-stopped distinction matters because they need different
    remediation: a stopped Smith just needs respawn; a hung Smith needs
    its process killed BEFORE respawn or else the OS sees two competing
    MCP clients and dual writes start corrupting state.

    Existence-only signals (pid file, process scan) are exactly what
    mask hangs in ``_smith_running()`` — here we *want* that blindness
    because we're explicitly looking for "alive but stuck".
