"""
Session lifecycle
=================
Scan start/complete, the live-state accessor (`get`), disk bootstrap
(`load_from_disk`), and the post-scan triage-flag helpers
(`set_triage_requested`, `note_triage_progress`).

Mutable state (``_current``, paths, ``PRESETS``) lives in the ``core.session``
package namespace so the suite can patch it as ``core.session.NAME``. This
module reaches it via ``import core.session as _sess`` and reads/rebinds
``_sess.<name>`` at call time — start()/load_from_disk() rebind
``_sess._current`` (the package attribute) exactly as the in-package versions
did, keeping every name patchable without introducing an import cycle.
