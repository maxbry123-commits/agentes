"""
The watchdog state machine: detect a dead/hung/stalled Smith mid-scan and
respawn it (or escalate) under a guard gauntlet.

``_watchdog_tick`` routes the detectors and the respawn hand-off through the
parent (``_api.<name>``) so the dashboard's tests can patch any one of them;
sibling notify/respawn helpers and the no-progress counter go through the
package object (``_smith.<name>``). Tuning constants are imported directly.
