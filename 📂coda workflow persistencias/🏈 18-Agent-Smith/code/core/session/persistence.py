"""
Session persistence + cross-process reconciliation
===================================================
The on-disk ``session.json`` writer (`_flush`), the cross-process state
reconciler (`_reconcile_if_external_write`), the lazy stale-PID refresher
(`_refresh_smith_pid_if_stale`), and the `smith_proc` scan-lock helpers
(`set_smith_proc`, `get_scan_client`).

The mutable state these mutate/rebind — ``_current``, ``_SESSION_FILE``,
``_REPO_ROOT``, ``_last_local_write_mtime``, ``_last_pid_refresh_attempt`` —
lives in the ``core.session`` package namespace so the suite can patch it as
``core.session.NAME``. This module reaches it via ``import core.session as
_sess`` and reads/rebinds ``_sess.<name>`` at call time (never at import
time), which keeps the package importable without a cycle and keeps every
name patchable.

    correctness benefits:

      1. Cross-process state desync — dashboard process and MCP server each
         keep their own ``_current``; a stale flush in one can silently undo
         the other's write. Reconciling against disk first eliminates the
         hot case (operator clicks Complete Scan, next MCP mutation is about
         to overwrite it).
      2. Stale smith.pid tracking — the dashboard's _smith_running() check
         consults logs/smith.pid first; if that file points at a dead PID
         (e.g., the original Smith died and a new one took over outside the
         dashboard restart path), the check fails and the watchdog fires a
         false "Smith stopped" alert. Re-detecting the caller on the fly
