Scan session
============
Defines the target, scope, depth, and hard limits for a pentest run.
A scan ends when Claude calls complete_scan() OR when any hard limit is hit —
whichever comes first.

Depth presets
-------------
  recon    — port scan + subdomains + HTTP probe only
             fast, low-noise, safe to run on most targets
             default limits: $0.10  |  15 min  |  10 tool calls

  standard — recon + nuclei vuln scan + directory fuzzing
             catches the most common issues without being too loud
             default limits: $0.50  |  45 min  |  25 tool calls

  thorough — standard + full Kali toolchain (nikto, sqlmap, testssl, …)
             comprehensive but noisy — confirm authorisation first
             default limits: $100.00  |  8 hours  |  unlimited tool calls

Hard limit enforcement
----------------------
Call check_limits(cost_summary) before running any tool.
Returns a stop-message string when a limit is exceeded; None otherwise.
The stop message is returned directly to Claude as the tool result, which
causes it to stop invoking further tools and write the final report.

Output file
-----------
  session.json  (served by core/api_server at GET /api/session)

Layout
------
The implementation is split across focused submodules; import from
``core.session`` exactly as before — every name is re-exported here.

  __init__        this file — mutable state (_current), presets, _TRIGGER_MAP,
                  cross-process reconciliation bookkeeping vars, and the facade
  lifecycle       scan start/complete, get, load_from_disk, triage flags
  limits          hard-limit enforcement (check_limits/_stop), remaining,
                  context-pressure tracking (charge_context/get_context_pressure)
  intervention    Human-Intervention-Required (HIR) trigger/resolve/get
  persistence     session.json flush, cross-process reconcile, stale-PID
                  refresh, and the smith_proc scan-lock helpers
  process_detect  Smith caller detection (_detect_smith_caller + helpers)
  gates           gate tracking + skill/step/tools-called bookkeeping
  assets          known-assets vault, tool-invocation log, spider-failure gate
  setup_gates     manual-setup capability gates (capabilities.yaml)

The mutable ``_current`` cache, paths, and _TRIGGER_MAP live here in the package
namespace so they stay patchable as ``core.session.NAME`` (the suite patches
_SESSION_FILE, _current, _REPO_ROOT, _last_local_write_mtime, _detect_smith_caller).
The submodules read them back via ``import core.session as _sess`` and access
``_sess.<name>`` at call time — reading + mutating ``_current`` in place, and
(for start/complete/load/reconcile) rebinding ``_sess._current`` on the package
itself, so every name stays patchable and no import cycle forms.

# ── Cross-process state reconciliation bookkeeping ────────────────────────────
#
# The dashboard and the MCP server are separate Python processes that both
# read/write session.json. Each keeps its own in-memory `_current`. Without
# reconciliation, a write in process A can be silently undone by a stale
# `_flush()` in process B — e.g., the operator clicks Complete Scan on the
# dashboard (status → "complete"), then the MCP's next tool call flushes its
# stale `_current` (status → "running") on top of the dashboard's write.
#
# Strategy: track the mtime of our own last `_flush()` write. Before every
# mutation, compare against the on-disk mtime. If disk is newer than what we
# wrote, another process changed the file — reload it into `_current` before
# touching anything. Read-only callers don't reconcile (cost outweighs the
# benefit; they tolerate stale data fine).
#
# This isn't a real lock — TOCTTOU races between reconcile-read and the next
# write still exist — but it eliminates the common case of "every mutation
# silently undoes the operator's Complete click". The reconcile/flush/refresh
# logic itself lives in ``persistence`` and rebinds these package attributes
# via ``import core.session as _sess``.

# mtime (seconds since epoch) of the last `_flush()` write performed by THIS
# process. 0.0 means we haven't written yet; any disk mtime > this value is
# treated as "external write, reconcile before continuing".
_last_local_write_mtime: float = 0.0

# Epoch-second timestamp of the last lazy smith.pid refresh attempt. Rate-
# limits the psutil scan in _refresh_smith_pid_if_stale() so very high-frequency
# mutations (e.g., add_tool_called on every MCP tool result) don't pay for an
# expensive process_iter on every single call when the PID went stale.

# ``import core.session as _sess`` binds a package that already exposes
# _current, paths, _TRIGGER_MAP, and the reconcile bookkeeping vars. (Those
# modules only touch package attributes at call time, so this ordering is also
# belt-and-suspenders.) Every name below stays patchable as core.session.NAME.
