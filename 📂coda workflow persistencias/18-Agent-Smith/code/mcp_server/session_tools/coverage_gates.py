# every cell be ground through. Pushing the model past the floor used to drive

# the cross-cutting auto-closer (autoclose.py handles only cors/csrf/
# security_headers/cache). Each can only be closed by a bespoke authenticated
# request, so on a 55-endpoint app they alone add 5×55=275 pure-manual cells and
# dominate the matrix. Counting them in the FLOOR denominator makes 40% demand
# hundreds of hand-tests the pipeline can't assist with, so the floor becomes
# practically unreachable and the model rationally abandons it. Exclude them from
# the floor's denominator (they still exist in the matrix and stay visible as
# advisory gaps + are honestly closable by hand) so the floor measures the work
# the automated closers (sweep + auto_crosscutting) CAN actually drive to done.
