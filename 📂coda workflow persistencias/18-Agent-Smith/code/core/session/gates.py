"""
Session gate tracking + skill/step bookkeeping.

Gates are conditions (RCE confirmed, auth service detected, an endpoint type
discovered) that make certain skills mandatory before completion. Also here:
the active-skill history, the current-step checkpoint, and the tools-called
list. Every mutator reads/writes session ``_current`` and persists it through
``core.session`` (the ``_sess`` alias) so the file path + cache stay canonical.
