"""Three-phase scan model — the generic root fix for the depth regression.

  A. exploit   — deep, MATRIX-FREE hunt: drive high-value findings to their terminal
                 (RCE / pivot / takeover), exactly like the lean early builds that
                 actually went deep. No cell accounting, no breadth pressure.
  B. coverage  — the systematic coverage-matrix pass we have now (breadth / completeness).
  C. synthesis — compose ALL findings + primitives into proven kill-chains and reach the
                 maximal terminals (the compositional machinery, used where it helps).

Transitions are SATURATION-based, NEVER time/budget-based: a phase advances only when its
OWN goal is genuinely done. Every saturation criterion is DISCHARGEABLE (a documented
dead-end counts), so a phase always terminates — no runaway, and no budget cap needed. The
operator can always end the scan. The point of the ordering: DEPTH (A) runs to completion
BEFORE breadth (B) starts, so the coverage machinery can no longer starve the deep
exploitation the way it does today. Pure predicates + I/O-free helpers; the session module
persists the transition.
