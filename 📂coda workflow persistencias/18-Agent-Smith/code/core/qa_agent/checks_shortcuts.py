QA agent — anti-shortcut checks.

Catch corner-cutting on the coverage matrix: bulk N/A marking, tested cells
with no tool evidence, impossibly fast cell closures, and N/A over-use.
``_check_bulk_marking`` / ``_check_coverage_integrity`` are blocking (gate
completion); the other two inject a steering directive and warn.
