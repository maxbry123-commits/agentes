The highest-value pentest output — the kill chain — is today 100% model-declared:
nothing PROPOSES which finding feeds which. This traverses the world-model graph
to surface candidate chains for the model to prove and file (the artifact-backed
`report(action='chain')` validation stays the gate — we only propose, never
assert). Pure: reads a Graph, returns proposals.
