"""
Adjudication completion gate
============================
Selects the findings that must carry a senior-review verdict before a scan may
complete, and emits the adjudication directive as a completion blocker.

Scope defaults to high/critical (matches mcp_server.session_tools
._finding_quality_blockers) — that's where over-estimation and false positives
hurt most. Widen via ADJUDICATION_SEVERITIES if ever needed; no config flag,
adjudication is always on.

Force-complete / limit-hit terminations are handled by NOT mutating findings
here: an un-reviewed finding simply never gains an `adjudication` object, so it
stays explicitly un-adjudicated rather than being silently confirmed.

Pure functions — no I/O.
