"""Keyword sets that fire mandatory skill gates from finding titles/notes.

This is the single home for the *gate-firing* vocabulary consumed by
``mcp_server.report_tools`` (RCE→post-exploit, K8s→container, cloud→cloud-security,
internal-net→network-assess, auth-weakness→credential-audit), plus the negative
markers that suppress a gate on benign or merely-speculative findings.

Deliberately SEPARATE from ``core.adjunction.rubric``: that module owns the
severity-scoring vocabulary (high/low-impact terms, terminal-blast-radius terms).
The two share words but answer different questions — "should a skill gate open?"
vs "what severity is this?" — and are tuned independently. Do not merge them.

# exactly as observed on the VulnBank run (post_exploit_rce opened on an app-takeover finding
