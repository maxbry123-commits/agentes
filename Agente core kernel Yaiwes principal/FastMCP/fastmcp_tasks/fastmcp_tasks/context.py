    Installed as core's background-context factory by ``TasksExtension`` so a
    ``ctx: Context`` parameter resolves inside a Docket worker. Returns ``None``
    when not running in a task (so core falls through to its usual error). The
    snapshot restored by ``restore_task_snapshot`` supplies the origin request
    id; the server prefers the one registered at submission time so mounted
    tasks resolve to the child server. No live session is attached — SEP-2663
    input and status are polled, so the worker needs no back-channel.

    For a re-entered leg (after the client answered a guard ask), the accumulated
    per-leg state is loaded and injected so the tool reads ``ctx.input_responses``
    / ``ctx.request_state`` identically to the foreground guard contract. Leg 1
    loads nothing (both ``None``).
