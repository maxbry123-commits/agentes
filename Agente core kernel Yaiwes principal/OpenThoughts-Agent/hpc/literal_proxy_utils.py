"""literal_proxy_utils.py — co-located RecordProxy wiring for literal-token capture.

Drives harbor's LITERAL-TOKEN trace machinery (``harbor.literal.proxy.RecordProxy``)
from the OT-Agent launch path. When ``--record_literal`` is set, the RL / datagen
launchers co-locate a :class:`~harbor.literal.proxy.RecordProxy` alongside the
on-cluster vLLM server and route the agent's inference endpoint THROUGH the proxy.
The proxy transparently injects ``return_token_ids=True`` / ``logprobs=True`` into
each forwarded completion and appends the returned prompt/completion token IDs +
logprobs to a ``literal.jsonl`` log, which the ``opencode`` agent (and any agent
with ``SUPPORTS_LITERAL_TRACES``) merges back into its trajectory steps.

Default OFF: :func:`maybe_serve_literal_proxy` is a NULL context manager that
yields the upstream vLLM endpoint UNCHANGED and starts no server, so the launch
path is byte-identical to today (parity gate G0).

Contract (from ``harbor/src/harbor/literal/proxy.py``, read 2026-07-03):
  * ``RecordProxy(upstream_base_url, log_path, timeout=600.0)`` — forwards to
    ``upstream_base_url`` by RE-APPENDING the FULL incoming request path
    (``url = upstream_base_url + request.url.path``). So ``upstream_base_url``
    MUST be the vLLM ORIGIN (``http://host:port``), NOT the agent-facing
    ``.../v1`` base: passing the ``/v1`` base doubles the segment
    (``/v1/v1/chat/completions``) and vLLM 404s the request. We strip the
    launcher's ``.../v1`` endpoint to its origin before handing it to RecordProxy.
  * ``RecordProxy.app()`` returns a FastAPI app serving ``/v1/chat/completions``
    and ``/v1/completions`` (the surface harbor's installed agents call). We serve
    that app with uvicorn on a co-located port; the agent's api_base points at it.

Nothing here binds a socket unless ``enabled`` is True — the pure helpers and the
disabled path are fully unit-testable without a server (see tests/hpc/test_literal_proxy.py).

    one that only re-runs export-push) would then overwrite attempt-0's populated log

    why pre-resume-fix jobs left 2-3 ``logs/*_literal.jsonl`` files), and the correlator
    already unions every matched file — so restoring per-serve uniqueness is the fix.

    The token folds in the iris task attempt id when present (``IRIS_TASK_ID`` gains a
    ``:N`` retry suffix on a preempt-retried task) plus a serve-start timestamp, so a
