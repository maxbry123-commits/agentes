# Hamilton UI Upgrade Guide

This guide covers backward compatibility concerns and migration steps when upgrading Hamilton UI.

## Upgrading from PostgreSQL 12 to PostgreSQL 18

**Affected versions:** Upgrading to versions after commit `0da07178` (February 2026)

### What Changed

Hamilton UI Docker setup now uses **PostgreSQL 18** instead of PostgreSQL 12 to support Django 6.0.2+, which requires PostgreSQL 13 or later.

**Important:** PostgreSQL 18 Docker images use a new data directory structure. The volume mount point has changed from `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql`. This allows PostgreSQL to store data in version-specific subdirectories (e.g., `/var/lib/postgresql/18/data`) and enables easier future upgrades using `pg_upgrade --link`.

**Why this matters:** You cannot simply change the image tag from `postgres:12` to `postgres:18` without migrating your data. The old volume will be incompatible with the new structure.

### Do I Need to Migrate?

**You need to migrate if ALL of the following are true:**
1. You have been using Hamilton UI with Docker (`./run.sh` or `./dev.sh`)
2. You have existing project data, runs, or artifacts you want to keep
3. You are upgrading from a version that used PostgreSQL 12

**You do NOT need to migrate if:**
- This is a fresh installation
- You don't care about preserving existing data
- You're using the PyPI package (`hamilton ui`) which uses SQLite by default

### Migration Options

#### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for Development)

If your data is not critical (development/testing), the simplest approach is to start fresh:

```bash
cd hamilton/ui

# Stop containers
./stop.sh

# Remove old PostgreSQL 12 data
docker volume rm ui_postgres_data

# Start with PostgreSQL 18
./run.sh --build
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This will delete all existing projects, runs, and artifacts.

#### Option 2: Migrate Your Data

If you need to preserve your data, follow these steps:

##### Step 1: Export data from PostgreSQL 12

While still using the old version:

```bash
cd hamilton/ui

# Ensure containers are running
docker compose up -d

# Export data
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres postgres > hamilton_backup.sql

# Stop containers
docker compose down
```

##### Step 2: Upgrade to PostgreSQL 18

```bash
# Remove old PostgreSQL 12 volume
docker volume rm ui_postgres_data

# Pull latest code with PostgreSQL 18
git pull  # or checkout the latest version

# Start new containers
./run.sh --build
```

##### Step 3: Import data into PostgreSQL 18

```bash
# Wait for database to be ready
sleep 10

# Import data
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres postgres < hamilton_backup.sql

# Verify data
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres postgres -c "\dt"
```

##### Step 4: Verify Migration

Navigate to http://localhost:8242 and verify:
- Your projects exist
- Run history is preserved
- Artifacts are accessible

##### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Import fails with "relation already exists"

The Hamilton UI automatically runs migrations on startup, which creates empty tables. Your import will skip those errors - this is normal.

**Issue:** Permission errors on import

```bash
# Grant permissions to hamilton user
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO postgres;"
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO postgres;"
```

**Issue:** Blob/artifact files missing

If you stored artifacts locally (not S3), you also need to copy the blob storage:

```bash
# Identify blob storage location (check docker-compose.yml)
docker compose exec backend ls /code/blobs

# If using local storage, copy blobs directory
cp -r old_blobs_directory new_blobs_directory
```

**Issue:** PostgreSQL 18 fails with "Error: in 18+, these Docker images are configured to store database data in a format which is compatible with pg_ctlcluster"

This error means you have old PostgreSQL data (from version 12 or 16) that's incompatible with PostgreSQL 18's new directory structure. The PostgreSQL 18 Docker image expects data in `/var/lib/postgresql` (not `/var/lib/postgresql/data`).

**Solution:** You must migrate your data using the migration scripts provided. Do not try to reuse the old volume:

```bash
# Remove the old volume (after backing up your data!)
docker compose down
docker volume rm ui_postgres_data

# Follow the migration guide above to export and import your data
./upgrade_postgres_simple.sh
```

If you're upgrading from PostgreSQL 16 to 18 and encounter this error, the volume mount point has changed. You still need to follow the migration process even though both versions are modern.

#### Option 3: Use pg_upgrade (Advanced)

For minimal downtime migrations, you can use PostgreSQL's `pg_upgrade` tool. This is more complex and generally not recommended for Hamilton UI due to its development-focused nature.

See [PostgreSQL pg_upgrade documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) for details.

## Other Breaking Changes

### Python Version (Internal)

The Docker images now use **Python 3.12** instead of Python 3.8. This is transparent to users - no action needed.

**Why:** Python 3.8 reached end-of-life in October 2024. Python 3.12 provides better performance and security.

### Dependency Management (Internal)

The Docker backend now uses **uv** instead of pip for dependency management. This is transparent to users - no action needed.

**Why:** uv provides faster installs and reproducible builds via lock files.

### Django 6.0+ Requirements

Django 6.0.2+ requires PostgreSQL 13 or later, which is why we upgraded to PostgreSQL 18.

## Migration Script

For automated migration, you can use this script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# upgrade_postgres.sh - Upgrade Hamilton UI from PostgreSQL 12 to 18

set -e

BACKUP_FILE="hamilton_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"

echo "Hamilton UI PostgreSQL 12 → 18 Migration"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

# Check if old containers are running
if ! docker compose ps | grep -q "ui-db"; then
    echo "Error: Hamilton UI containers not running. Start them first with ./run.sh"
    exit 1
fi

# Backup
echo "Step 1: Backing up PostgreSQL 12 data..."
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U postgres postgres > "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "✓ Backup saved to: $BACKUP_FILE"
echo ""

# Stop and remove
echo "Step 2: Stopping containers and removing old data..."
docker compose down
docker volume rm ui_postgres_data
echo "✓ Old data removed"
echo ""

# Start new
echo "Step 3: Starting PostgreSQL 18..."
./run.sh --build
sleep 15  # Wait for initialization
echo "✓ PostgreSQL 18 ready"
echo ""

# Restore
echo "Step 4: Restoring data..."
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres postgres < "$BACKUP_FILE" 2>&1 | grep -v "ERROR:.*already exists" || true
echo "✓ Data restored"
echo ""

# Fix permissions
echo "Step 5: Fixing permissions..."
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO postgres;" > /dev/null
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO postgres;" > /dev/null
echo "✓ Permissions fixed"
echo ""

echo "Migration complete!"
echo "Navigate to http://localhost:8242 to verify your data."
```

Save as `upgrade_postgres.sh`, make executable with `chmod +x upgrade_postgres.sh`, and run with `./upgrade_postgres.sh`.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Hamilton UI Version | PostgreSQL Version | Python Version | Django Version |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| < 0.0.17 (2026-02) | 12 | 3.8 | 4.2 |
| ≥ 0.0.17 (2026-02) | 18 | 3.12 | 6.0.2 |

## FAQ

**Q: Can I continue using PostgreSQL 12?**

No. Django 6.0.2+ explicitly requires PostgreSQL 13 or later. You must upgrade to at least PostgreSQL 13 (we recommend 18 for the latest features and long-term support).

**Q: Will my PyPI installation be affected?**

No. The PyPI package (`apache-hamilton-ui`) uses SQLite by default for local development. This upgrade only affects Docker deployments.

**Q: Can I downgrade if something goes wrong?**

Yes, as long as you keep your backup file:

```bash
# Checkout old version
git checkout <old_commit_before_upgrade>

# Remove new volume
docker volume rm ui_postgres_data

# Start old version
./run.sh --build

# Restore from backup (if needed)
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres postgres < hamilton_backup.sql
```

**Q: Do I need to update my Hamilton SDK client code?**

No. The Hamilton SDK (`apache-hamilton-sdk`) is compatible with both old and new versions of the UI backend. No client code changes required.
