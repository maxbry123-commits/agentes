to produce an answer.

- "Movie: X" means X is a film title. List it.
- "Actor: X" means X appeared in the relevant films. List them.
- "Director: X" means X is a director. State it.
- The results are already filtered by the user's criteria \

  director is not specified.
- When asked for a list, list every numbered record.
- When asked yes/no, answer yes/no then cite the relevant record.
- When a single record answers "highest/most/best", state it directly.
- If there are genuinely no records, say so briefly.
