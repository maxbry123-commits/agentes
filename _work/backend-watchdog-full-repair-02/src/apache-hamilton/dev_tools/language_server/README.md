# Apache Hamilton Language Server (`hamilton_lsp`)

> **Disclaimer**
>
> Apache Hamilton is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
>
> Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
>
> While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

This is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to provide a rich IDE experience when creating Apache Hamilton dataflows.

It currently powers the Apache Hamilton VSCode extension and could be integrated into other IDEs.

# Building from source

This package uses [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/) as its build backend (declared
in `pyproject.toml`). To build the source distribution and wheel from a source
checkout:

```bash
# from the dev_tools/language_server directory (the package root)
python -m pip install flit
flit build --no-use-vcs
# artifacts are written to dist/
```

`flit build` produces both the `.tar.gz` source distribution and the
`.whl` wheel. `--no-use-vcs` selects files from the working tree rather than
git, which is what you want when building from an unpacked source release.
