//! Translating BOTROSTER's vocabulary into ACP's.
//!
//! ACP is a published protocol (`docs/SPEC.md` §9) and BOTROSTER is the Agent
//! side of it. Most of the adapter is transport. This module is the part that
//! is not: BOTROSTER knows more about how a turn ended than ACP has words for,
//! and every place a richer vocabulary is squashed into a poorer one is a
//! place where a client is quietly told something untrue.
//!
//! `FinishReason` has more variants than `StopReason`. The mapping is
//! therefore a set of decisions, not a lookup table, and each decision is
//! documented next to the code that makes it.
