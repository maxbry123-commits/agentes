///
/// # What this defends
///
/// Browsers do not apply CORS to WebSocket handshakes. `new
/// WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8443/v1/tools")` from any page a person visits
/// reaches this listener, and the handshake here is a plain JSON text frame a
/// page can send. Nothing further along distinguished that page from the
/// desktop client: every connection was handed `dev_principal()`, and an
/// approval is authorised on socket identity — so a page that opens its own
/// session is the owner of it, and is the one the hub asks for permission.
///
/// While a computer is running, that made every page the person browsed able to
/// read their workspace, drive their logged-in browser, and run `shell.exec` by
/// approving its own request. `docs/SPEC.md` §11.5 names prompt injection as a
/// top risk and says approvals are the mitigation; an approval answered by the
/// attacker is not one.
///
/// # Why the check is this shape
///
/// A browser is required to send `Origin` on a WebSocket handshake and cannot
/// be made not to. A native client has no origin to send and sends none. So the
/// presence of the header — not its value — is the signal, and an allow-list of
/// origins would be the weaker test: it invites `null`, and it invites someone
/// to add an entry later without noticing they have re-opened the door.
///
/// This is one of two independent halves. A page also cannot set request
/// headers on a WebSocket, so a credential in the upgrade closes the same path
/// by a different route; that is the other half, and it defends against a local
/// process, which this one does not.
