# The gates. Exit non-zero on any failure; print a machine-readable summary last.
#
# A change that fails one of these gets reverted, not argued with. Two of the
# gates in LOOP.md needed translating rather than inventing, and the honest
# translation is recorded here:
#
#   "frontend typecheck and production build" — there is no TypeScript and no
#   bundler. `crates/botroster-app/ui/` is three hand-written files served
#   verbatim by Tauri. The real equivalent is a syntax check on the shipped
#   script plus `cargo test -p botroster-app --test page`, which drives that
#   exact file in a real browser and is where the behaviour is actually pinned.
#
#   "bundle size" — the *compressed* byte size of ui/*.{html,js,css} plus any
#   vendored fonts. Baseline in .claude/ux-loop/.baseline-bytes, fail on >15%
#   growth. The file is named for the unit on purpose: it is gitignored, so a
#   machine that ran the old gate still has a `.baseline-bytes` holding a raw
#   number. Read as a compressed one it would put the ceiling at three times
#   the real size and pass everything forever — a gate that has silently
#   stopped gating, which is worse than one that fails. A new name means that
#   file is simply not this file, and the baseline is recorded on first run.
#
#   Measured gzipped rather than raw, for the reason in BASELINE.md:
#   this repository requires comments explaining what broke and why, comments
#   were 44% of the raw bundle, and a raw ceiling is therefore mostly a limit
#   on how much of the reasoning survives. Gzip discounts prose by roughly ten
#   to one and counts novel code close to full, which is the thing the ceiling
#   was put there to watch.

# whole gate on the installed app in %LOCALAPPDATA%\BOTROSTER — a different file
# on a different path that cargo never writes to. A gate that stops the run for
