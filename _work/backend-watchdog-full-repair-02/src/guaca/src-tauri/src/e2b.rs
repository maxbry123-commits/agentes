//! E2B sandboxes: one computer per agent.
//!
//! An agent that can only emit text is limited to what the model already knows.
//! A sandbox gives it a machine with a shell, a network, and a desktop that can
//! be watched.
//!
//! Two protocols, because E2B uses two:
//!
//! - The control plane at `api.e2b.app` is plain REST with an `X-API-Key`
//!   header: create, list, kill.
//! - Everything *inside* a sandbox goes to `envd`, which speaks Connect RPC on
//!   port 49983 of the sandbox's own hostname. `run` below implements the JSON
//!   form of that protocol directly rather than pulling in a gRPC stack, since
//!   one streaming method covers everything Guac needs.
//!
//! Running a command is the only primitive that matters here. The agent's tool
//! is a command, the operator's terminal is a command, and the desktop itself
//! is four commands, so `run` is what the rest of the file is built from.
//!
//! Replaces an earlier Daytona integration, which was dropped because its
//! sandboxes have no internet access below the Tier 3 plan. An agent that
//! cannot reach the network cannot look anything up, which is most of the point
//! of giving it a computer.
//!
//! ## A computer is looked at, never asked
//!
//! There used to be a second way to use the web on one of these machines:
//! Chrome was started with its remote debugging port open and driven over the
//! DevTools protocol, which knows where every element is and needs no pointer.
//! Exact when it worked, and it did not work here often enough to keep. The
//! port belongs to a profile, so it was lost every time anything re-attached to
//! that profile; a page had to be read, numbered, and then acted on by a number
//! that a re-render had already invalidated; and an agent reading the screen
//! and an agent asking the page disagreed about which window was in front. Each
//! of those was fixed once and came back wearing another name.
//!
//! So a computer is now exactly what it looks like: a screen, a pointer and a
//! keyboard. `screenshot` and `act_on_desktop` are the whole interface, and
//! there is no privileged channel into the browser for anything to fall out of
//! sync with. An agent that wants a page asked rather than looked at gets a
//! browser instead, which is a different thing on a different provider:
//! `kernel.rs`.
