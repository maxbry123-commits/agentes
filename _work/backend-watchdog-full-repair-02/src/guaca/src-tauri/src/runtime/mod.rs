//! Every agent is a task with an unbounded inbox. Sending is enqueue-and-return,

//! and four peers think concurrently. That is the whole reason this lives in
//! Rust rather than in the webview.
//!
//! Locks here are `parking_lot` and every critical section is short and
//! synchronous. Nothing holds a lock across an `.await`; the guard registry in
//! particular is locked, consulted, and released before any inference starts.

    ///   in it are its to spend. See the type, which carries the argument.
    /// - the action changes something rather than reading it. Navigating,
    ///   scrolling and going back are how a page gets read at all.
    /// - this turn has already taken in a page or a screen. An agent told to go
    ///   and post something acts on the operator's instruction; an agent that
    ///   read a page first may be acting on the page's.
    /// - the browser is standing on a site this agent holds a session for. That

    ///   it is exactly the condition that makes the payload worth writing.
