//! The Codex backend, which is where a ChatGPT subscription can be spent.
//!
//! Guaca speaks one shape of model API everywhere else: OpenAI-compatible
//! `/chat/completions`, a list of messages in and a stream of deltas out. The
//! subscription backend does not offer that endpoint. It speaks the Responses
//! API, which is a different request body, a different item model and a
//! different set of stream events for the same conversation. So this file is a
//! translation, and it is the only place in the app that knows there are two
//! protocols.
//!
//! Translating rather than teaching the runtime a second protocol is a
//! deliberate trade. It costs this file, which has to be right about both
//! shapes. It saves every other file: `runtime/mod.rs` assembles one kind of
//! request, `prompt.rs` writes one kind of history, tool results come back one
//! way, and none of them gain a branch for how the operator is paying.
//!
//! ## What the two protocols disagree about
//!
//! - **The system prompt is not a message.** It is `instructions`, a field
//!   beside the input, and the endpoint returns 400 without one.
//! - **A tool result is not a role.** Chat completions send `role: "tool"`
//!   carrying a `tool_call_id`. Responses send a `function_call_output` item
//!   carrying a `call_id`, as a sibling of the `function_call` item it answers.
//! - **A tool definition is flat.** `{type, name, description, parameters}`,
//!   not `{type, function: {...}}`. The nested form is accepted and then the
//!   model is never offered the tool, which presents as an agent that has
//!   forgotten how to do its job.
//! - **There is no temperature.** The endpoint rejects the parameter outright
//!   rather than ignoring it, so a request carrying one fails in full.
//! - **Nothing says `[DONE]`.** The stream ends on `response.completed`, and
//!   the usage arrives inside it rather than in a frame of its own.
//!
//! ## What a subscription does not report
//!
//! A price. Every other endpoint Guaca talks to either charges per token and
//! says what it charged, or is local and charges nothing. A subscription has
//! already been paid for, so the tokens are counted and the cost is `None`,
//! which is the same thing a local model reports and reads correctly everywhere
//! downstream.
//!
//! ## Reasoning is asked for and not kept
//!
//! Summaries are requested, streamed to the operator as they arrive, and
//! dropped. The encrypted reasoning blobs that would let a later round resume
//! the model's own working are deliberately *not* requested: keeping them would
//! mean persisting reasoning and sending it back, which the rest of this app
//! promises never to do. The cost is that a multi-round turn re-reasons from its
//! tool results instead of continuing. The alternative is breaking the one
//! promise `Token::Reasoning` exists to keep.
