//! Per-agent memory on disk.
//!
//! Each agent owns one small markdown file that it can rewrite, and that is
//! shown to it at the start of every turn. This is the smallest thing that
//! deserves the name memory, and the shape is deliberate.
//!
//! It is called memory everywhere now, in the code as well as in the app. It
//! was `notes` internally for a year, on the argument that renaming would
//! rewrite the IPC contract to no effect. That stopped being true the moment
//! there was a second store: with working notes beside it, `notes` named two
//! things with opposite lifetimes, and the one word nobody could use without
//! saying which one they meant was the word the code used everywhere.
//! `update_notes` survives as a parse alias and nothing else.
//!
//! What lives here is only half of what an agent carries. The other half is
//! `domain::worknote`, and the line between them is what each is for: this file
//! holds what the agent knows, and could not look up again; a working note
//! holds where its work stands, and expires. The two shapes are opposites on
//! purpose, and the reasoning for that is in `worknote.rs` rather than repeated
//! here.
//!
//! The 2026 survey of agent memory (arXiv 2603.07670) frames memory as a
//! write-manage-read loop and names the engineering realities that decide
//! whether it works: write-path filtering, contradiction handling, continual
//! consolidation, and learned forgetting. Three design choices here follow
//! directly from that:
//!
//! - **Always resident, never retrieved.** The file is small enough to sit in
//!   the prompt, so there is no retrieval step to get wrong and no relevance
//!   model to tune. Retrieval machinery earns its place at a scale this does
//!   not reach.
//! - **Replace, never append.** The only write is a full rewrite, which forces
//!   the agent to reconcile what it already believed against what it just
//!   learned. Append-only turns into the transcript it was supposed to
//!   summarize.
//! - **A hard cap.** Forgetting has to be someone's decision. A ceiling makes
//!   the agent choose what survives rather than letting the file grow until it
//!   crowds out the conversation.

/// preferences, durable facts, and pointers to the documents worth reopening.
///
/// It was 4,000, which is one page, and every agent doing real work was jammed
/// against it. Measured across a workspace of twenty-one: the ten busiest were
/// all above 3,800, four were within a hundred characters of the ceiling, and
/// **more than half of every turn that wrote to memory had to write twice**,
/// because the first attempt came back cut. That is a whole extra model call,
/// paid on half of the memory writes in the workspace, and memory was the most
/// used tool in it.
///
/// Naming the number in the tool description did not help, which is the
/// evidence that mattered: the models were not guessing the cap, they had more
/// state than the cap held.
///
/// That measurement predates the split, and some of what it measured was
/// pressure this file should never have been under. A fifth of the same
/// workspace's memory was progress, which now goes to `domain::worknote`, and
/// more again was documents restated rather than pointed at. Whether four pages
/// is still the right size is a question for the next measurement rather than
/// this one, and it is deliberately not lowered on a prediction: being wrong
/// upward costs prompt tokens, and being wrong downward costs back the extra
/// model call on half of all writes that this bought.
///
/// Mirrored in `Memory.tsx` as `CAP`, which the suite pins to this by reading
/// this file. The two drifted to 4,000 against 16,000 once, and the panel spent
/// that release telling operators their memory was about to be cut by a runtime
/// that was storing it whole.
