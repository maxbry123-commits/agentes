//! Where the runtime is running, and the handful of things that decides.
//!
//! Guaca runs in two places. In the desktop app it is a `tokio` runtime inside
//! the window's own process, on the operator's machine, with their disk and
//! their programs. On a server it is a daemon on a machine reached over a
//! network, and the operator is somewhere else entirely.
//!
//! ## Two, not three
//!
//! An operator chooses between three things: run it here, run it on a box I
//! rent, or let guaca.ai hand me one. The runtime only ever sees two, because
//! the difference between the last two is who pressed the button at the
//! provider. A managed box and an operator's own box run the same binary, hold
//! the same state and refuse the same things, and nothing below this line can
//! tell them apart or has any business trying. Whoever provisioned it is a fact
//! about the bill, and the bill is not the runtime's subject.
//!
//! That is also what makes bring-your-own-box free rather than a second
//! product: there is no managed code path to fall out of step with.
//!
//! ## What it decides, and where the decision is read
//!
//! Resource paths and endpoint addresses are resolved by the backend. Both
//! hosts can use their own directories and network; neither can read the
//! other machine's files or credentials just because a client connects.
//!
//! The rule is that a refusal is drawn **in the panel, before anything is
//! spent**, and never discovered at turn time. This is the same shape as a
//! model named on a group running on Claude, which is kept and never used and
//! says so on the row: a capability that is quietly absent is the one thing
//! nothing else on screen would explain.
