//! Asking the operator before doing something they would want a say in.
//!
//! An agent's tools all act on its own machine, its own notes or its own peers.
//! Some things reach further than that, and those stop and ask. The mechanism is
//! general because the answer has to be recorded either way: which agent asked,
//! for what, and what the operator said. [`ProtectedAction`] has one variant
//! today, and adding a second is a variant plus the call site that raises it.
//!
//! The wording an operator reads is composed here from what the runtime already
//! validated, never by the model. An agent that could write its own request
//! could describe creating an agent as tidying up. Where a request is
//! necessarily about something only the agent can describe, its words appear as
//! a quoted detail field, under a heading the runtime wrote.
