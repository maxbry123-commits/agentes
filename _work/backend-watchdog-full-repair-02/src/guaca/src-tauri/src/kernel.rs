//! Kernel browsers: one browser per agent.
//!
//! A computer and a browser are different things an agent can be given, and
//! this is the second one. A computer (`e2b.rs`) is a Linux machine with a
//! screen: an agent works it by looking at pixels and aiming a pointer, which
//! is how a person uses a computer and is as approximate as that sounds. A
//! browser is a hosted Chrome and nothing else, driven over the DevTools
//! protocol, so every link, button and field is named rather than guessed at.
//!
//! The two are not ranked. A page is better asked than looked at, so anything
//! on the web belongs on the browser. Everything that is not a web page has no
//! DOM to ask and belongs on the computer: a shell, a file, a PDF viewer, an
//! installer, a desktop application. An agent may hold both, and they
//! share nothing: separate cookie jars, separate sign-ins, separate sessions
//! the operator has to establish once each.
//!
//! ## Why a provider whose whole product is one browser
//!
//! Chrome's remote interface used to be opened on the E2B machine, and it did
//! not survive contact with a general-purpose desktop: the port belongs to a
//! profile and was lost whenever anything re-attached to that profile, and two
//! ways to use the web on one screen disagreed about which window was in front.
//! Here the browser *is* the product. There is one, it is the only thing in the
//! sandbox, the socket is handed out at creation, and there is no second route
//! to the same window for anything to fall out of step with.
//!
//! ## Two protocols, as with the other provider
//!
//! - The control plane at `api.onkernel.com` is plain REST with a bearer token:
//!   create, look up, delete, and profiles.
//! - Driving a browser is the DevTools protocol on the `cdp_ws_url` that
//!   creation returns. `cdp.rs` speaks it.
//!
//! ## Where a sign-in lives
//!
//! A browser session is disposable; a *profile* is not. Each agent gets one
//! named profile, every browser it is given is created against that profile
//! with `save_changes`, and the cookies are written back when the browser is
//! deleted or times out. That is the same property the E2B machine gets from
//! its disk surviving a sleep, reached a different way, and it is why an
//! operator signs an agent in once rather than once a session.
//!
//! One writer at a time, which the provider does not enforce: two browsers open
//! on one profile means the last one closed overwrites the other's cookies. So
//! an agent holds at most one browser, recorded on its row, and a second is
//! never created while the first is alive.
