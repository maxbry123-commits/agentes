//! Opening a workspace, which is the same act in both hosts.
//!
//! A workspace is a database, three settings files and two directories, and
//! bringing one up is the same sequence whether the runtime ends up behind a
//! window or behind a socket: open the store, close whatever a restart
//! stranded, read the settings, build the runtime, start the loops that keep
//! their own time, and release anything a previous process left running at a
//! provider.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `app.rs` because two copies would drift, and
//! the drift would be silent in the worst way: a loop started in one host and
//! forgotten in the other is a workspace where routines never fire, and nothing
//! reports it because nothing is wrong. The desktop is the host that has been
//! shipping, so this is written to be exactly what it already did.
//!
//! What is *not* here is anything either host does alone. A menu bar, a
//! downloads folder and a `guacfile:` scheme are the window's; a listening
//! socket and a bearer token are the daemon's. Both are handed in.
