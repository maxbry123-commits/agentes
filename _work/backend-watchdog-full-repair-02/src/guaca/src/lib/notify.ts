/**
 * Telling the operator something happened while they were not looking.
 *
 * The hard part is not raising a notification, it is refusing to. Guaca runs
 * unattended: routines fire on a schedule, an agent parks on a permission
 * request and waits ten minutes for an answer, a cascade settles long after the
 * message that started it. All of that is worth knowing about when you are
 * elsewhere and none of it is worth a badge when you are watching it happen.
 *
 * So a notification has to pass three gates, and they are not the same gate:
 *
 *   the kind      is this something you asked to hear about
 *   the moment    are you actually elsewhere, and elsewhere from what
 *   the burst     has this already been said in the last second
 *
 * The second is where the judgment is. "Away" is not one condition, because a
 * permission request and a finished conversation are not the same news:
 *
 *   attention   an agent is blocked on you, whether or not its turn is parked.
 *               Reaches you when the window is not in front of you, and also
 *               when it is but the request belongs to a channel you are not
 *               looking at. Nobody finds a parked turn by noticing a row change
 *               color three screens up the rail, and nobody finds an agent that
 *               gave up four turns ago by reading its channel.
 *   ambient     nothing was addressed to you and no channel is implied. A
 *               routine fires wherever it was pointed. Reaches you whenever you
 *               are away, with no channel to match against.
 *   completion  the end of something you started. Reaches you only when you are
 *               away AND it is the channel you were last looking at, because a
 *               busy runtime settles runs in channels you have never opened and
 *               one badge each would make the whole mechanism worth turning off.
