/**
 * The colors a chart is allowed to use.
 *
 * Eight hues in one fixed order, assigned to series by position and never
 * cycled. The order is the accessibility mechanism, not a preference: what
 * makes a chart readable to a red-green colorblind operator is that
 * *neighboring* slots stay far apart, because neighboring slots are the ones
 * that touch in a stack, sit side by side in a group, and cross in a line
 * chart. A palette picked by eye fails that test roughly always.
 *
 * So this one was not picked by eye. The eight hexes are a documented set with
 * published separation figures; what this file chose is the order, by
 * enumerating all 40,320 of them and keeping only the 160 that clear every
 * gate in both surfaces. Guaca opens on green because Guaca is green, and that
 * choice cost nothing: of the orders that pass, this is one of the best.
 *
 * Measured on this app's own chart surface (`--raised`: `#ffffff` on paper,
 * `#171715` on ink), simulating protanopia and deuteranopia at full severity,
 * as OKLab distance ×100:
 *
 * | gate                        | target | paper | ink  |
 * |-----------------------------|--------|-------|------|
 * | neighbors, colorblind     | ≥ 8    | 9.1   | 8.4  |
 * | neighbors, full color     | ≥ 15   | 19.6  | 19.3 |
 * | first three, every pair     | ≥ 8    | 13.0  | 13.0 |
 *
 * The last row is the one scatter needs, where any two dots can end up
 * touching and "neighbors" means nothing. Nine hues is not an option: a
 * generated ninth is indistinguishable from one of these eight under
 * colorblindness, so a ninth series folds into an "Other" instead.
 *
 * `palette.test.ts` recomputes every figure above from these hexes. It is the
 * gate, not a note about one: a hex edited here fails the suite.
 *
 * Ink is not paper flipped. It is the same eight hues re-stepped for a dark
 * ground, chosen and measured as its own set, which is why green is the one
 * value that repeats: it already sat in both bands.
