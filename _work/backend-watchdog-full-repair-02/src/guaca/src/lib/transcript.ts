/**
 * A channel, arranged the way it is read.
 *
 * Three kinds of thing land in one agent's channel and they want three
 * different amounts of room:
 *
 * - what the operator and that agent said to each other: full bubbles, the
 *   only messages written to be read in full
 * - what the agent exchanged with its peers: one centered line per peer, with
 *   the exchange itself a click away
 * - what the agent did on its own turn: tool trails, guard stops, refusals
 *
 * The middle one is why this is a pass over the list rather than a decision
 * per message. Peer traffic arrives in bursts (a fan-out, then the answers
 * landing milliseconds apart) and a line each buries the operator's own
 * conversation just as thoroughly as bubbles did, only in smaller type. So a
 * burst collapses to one row saying how much of it there was and with whom,
 * and anything that is not peer traffic ends the burst, because a tool trail
 * between two exchanges is a break in what was happening.
 *
 * Counts are of what this channel holds, which is what the operator is
 * looking at. An agent's automatic replies are filed in the channel of
 * whoever they went to, so the thread behind the row can hold more than the
 * row counted. That is the right way round: clicking reveals more, never
 * less.
