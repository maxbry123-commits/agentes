/**
 * What an interruption would say, decided one event at a time.
 *
 * `notify` owns whether the operator hears anything and has its own tests; this
 * decides what would be said and which channel it is about. Both ways of
 * getting that wrong are quiet. An announcement per event rather than per thing
 * that happened is a badge for every token of a reply, and the operator's only
 * answer to that is the master switch. And the channel is not decoration:
 * `notify` holds a completion back unless the operator was already looking at
 * that channel, so a kind labeled with the wrong one reaches nobody, or
 * reaches them for a run they have never opened.
 *
 * The one piece of state here, a run's channel, is module-level and outlives a
 * render, so what it forgets matters as much as what it learns.
