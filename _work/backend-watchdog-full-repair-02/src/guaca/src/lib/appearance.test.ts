/**
 * Appearance, as the three things the root element is asked to carry.
 *
 * jsdom resolves no `var()` and does no layout, so nothing here can be asked
 * what color it drew. What it can be asked is what `styles.css` is keyed on:
 * the `data-surface` attribute, the `--ui-scale` multiplier, and the
 * `color-scheme` the engine reads for its own controls. Those three are the
 * whole contract between this file and the stylesheet, and each has a wrong
 * value that still draws a window.
 *
 * Two of them are load-bearing past the obvious. `system` must never reach the
 * attribute, because the stylesheet has one dark block and it is keyed on
 * `dark`: written through verbatim, an operator who asked the OS gets paper in
 * a dark room. And no `--rail-*` name may be written at all: the navigation
 * columns follow the surface through the stylesheet's own dark block, so an
 * inline override from here would pin them to one surface and look deliberate.
