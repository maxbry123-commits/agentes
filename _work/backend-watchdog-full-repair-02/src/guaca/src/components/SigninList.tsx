/**
 * What an agent is signed in to, and where. Read, not written.
 *
 * There is nothing to fill in here on purpose. Whatever holds the cookies
 * knows, so Guaca asks it rather than asking the operator to keep a list up to
 * date: sign in and it appears, log out and it goes. The list is also on every
 * peer's roster, which is what lets a crew route work to the one agent that can
 * do it.
 *
 * Each row says which of the agent's two places holds the session, and that is
 * not decoration. A computer and a browser have unrelated cookie jars, so an
 * operator looking at "LinkedIn" needs to know which window the agent will find
 * it in, and which one to sign in through next time.
 *
 * The scan runs when this opens and again whenever the agent has been working,
 * so the usual case is that it is already right by the time anyone looks.
