/**
 * What two agents said to each other, on its own.
 *
 * The channel shows that an exchange happened and with whom; this is where it
 * is read. It is a separate view rather than a modal because it is a
 * conversation, sometimes a long one, and a dialog over the top of the window
 * is a bad place to read forty messages.
 *
 * Read-only, and said so on the page. Neither of these agents is addressable
 * from here: a message the operator typed into this thread would have to be
 * sent as one of them, which is not a thing this app lets anybody do. Saying
 * "view-only" is cheaper than a composer that refuses.
 *
 * Loaded from the runtime rather than from what the channel already holds,
 * because no channel holds it. A send is filed under the recipient and the
 * answer under the sender, and an automatic reply leaves no trace at all in
 * the channel of the agent that wrote it.
