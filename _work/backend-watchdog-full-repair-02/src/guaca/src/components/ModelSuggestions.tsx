/**
 * Three models for the agent being written, under the field that holds one.
 *
 * The model field is a text box on purpose: any slug the endpoint accepts, and
 * the endpoint is the operator's to choose. That is right and it is also a blank
 * box, and a blank box is no help at all to somebody who has just decided they
 * want an agent that reads contracts. This is the help, and it stays a text box.
 *
 * Nothing here is a setting. It reads what the operator has already written into
 * the dialog, asks OpenRouter which models get that kind of work, and offers to
 * fill the field in. Pressing one is the same edit as typing, and the dialog is
 * not saved by it.
 *
 * ## When it says nothing
 *
 * Three ways, and all three are the common case rather than a failure:
 *
 * - The agent is not any of OpenRouter's twelve use cases. Most are not.
 * - The agent's turns are not paid for by OpenRouter, so a slug ranked there
 *   would be a model the endpoint refuses by name.
 * - OpenRouter did not answer. Then it says so, once, quietly: this sits beside
 *   a field that works perfectly well without it.
