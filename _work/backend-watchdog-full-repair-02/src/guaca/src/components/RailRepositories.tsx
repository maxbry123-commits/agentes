/**
 * The codebases a crew works in, as headings with their agents under them.
 *
 * ## Why they are here and not in settings
 *
 * A repository was a row in a settings page, which is where a thing goes when
 * the app considers it configuration. For an operator whose day is repositories
 * that is the wrong shelf: which codebases this crew has, and who is on each,
 * is the first question asked on opening the app and it was three clicks deep.
 *
 * ## Why this is a tree and not two lists
 *
 * An agent works in at most one repository, so every agent has exactly one
 * place in the rail: under its codebase, or under the crew if it has none.
 * That is the whole reason the exclusive rule is worth its cost. A
 * many-to-many cannot be drawn as a tree, and the version that tried put every
 * name in two places at once and left the operator working out which of them
 * was the real row.
 *
 * The rows here are the rail's own rows, passed in rather than reinvented, so
 * an agent under a repository is the same row with the same menu, the same
 * activity and the same drag as an agent anywhere else. Only its indent
 * differs.
 *
 * ## Why they are not circles in the crews column
 *
 * That column is crews, and dropping an agent on one moves it between crews.
 * Dropping here moves it between codebases inside the crew it is already in.
 * Both are moves, which is what makes the gesture learnable, but they move
 * different things, so they are different furniture in different places.

 *

 * upstream, or one with no upstream at all, which is why the arrows are drawn
 * off `upstream` and not off the counts. No pull request count is `gh` not
 * installed, not signed in, or a repository GitHub has never heard of: drawn as
 * `0 PR` each of those would say there is nothing waiting for review, which is
