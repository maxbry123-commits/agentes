 * That the agent is still going, above the box you would type into, and what it

 *
 * The sidebar already says "typing" beside the name, but the operator watching
 * a channel is looking at the bottom of it, waiting. A silent gap between
 * sending and the first token is the moment the app looks broken, and it is a
 * long one: a turn can spend several model calls on tool results before a word
 * is written for anybody to read. A pulse says the turn is alive; it does not
 * say what it is doing, and those are different questions when the wait is ten
 * minutes.
 *
 * So the line says the most specific true thing available, in this order:
 *
 * - **A call that has not come back.** While a command runs or a page loads,
 *   the model is not thinking and its last thought is frozen and stale, which
 *   is the state that reads as a hang. Naming the call and counting the seconds
 *   is the difference between waiting and wondering.
 * - **What it is working through**, as the model's own section heading and the
 *   last sentence it finished under it. `lib/reasoning.ts` decides both, and
 *   the whole of the working is one click away.
 * - **That it is working**, which is all there is to say where the provider
 *   publishes nothing. Revealed on hover, because whose channel this is has
 *   been established four times over by the time you reach the bottom of it. It
 *   stays in the accessibility tree either way, which is why that is opacity
 *   rather than a mount.
 *
 * At the end of it are the three things that are not the sentence: what the
 * turn has spent, how much it has done, and the one control that stops it. The
 * count is the whole of the trail while the turn runs and opens into the rest
 * of it; the credentials are named rather than counted, because a name is the
 * operator's audit trail for their own tokens and is not a thing to put behind
 * a click; and Stop is always drawn, because it is the one thing on screen that
 * costs money to leave alone.
 *
 * Subscribed here rather than in the parent for the same reason `LiveStreams`
 * is: what it draws changes every sixteen milliseconds and everything around it
 * does not.
