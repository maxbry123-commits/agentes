 * before its name is read. How they stand is the crew's size: `lib/orb.ts` owns
 * the seating and says why. The name is still not drawn *under* the circle,
 * because the column is four rem wide and a name cut to fit it is a name nobody
 * can read: it is drawn beside the circle, over the app, whenever the circle is
 * pointed at or focused. `OrbTag` has the rest of that argument, including why
 * faces alone were never enough to tell two crews apart.
 *
 * Two jobs in one control, which is why it is a circle and not a row in a menu.
 * Clicking opens the group. Dropping an agent on it puts the agent in the group,
 * so the shortest gesture for moving somebody between crews is the one that also
 * says which crew, and it is on screen the whole time you are dragging.
