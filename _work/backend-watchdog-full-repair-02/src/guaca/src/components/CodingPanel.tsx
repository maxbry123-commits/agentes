/**
 * What a coding agent is doing right now, in the channel of the agent that
 * asked for it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `code` returns as soon as the harness is up and the turn ends, so the channel
 * goes silent while a coding agent works in the repository for twenty minutes.
 * The operator's own words for it: the chat is quiet and the only evidence
 * anything is happening is pull requests appearing on GitHub. The rail says
 * `building` beside the repository, which answers *whether*; this answers
 * *what*.
 *
 * ## Why it is a filtered line and not the stream
 *
 * `pi --mode json` emits tens of thousands of events for a real job, almost all
 * of them text deltas and a cumulative usage total repeated on each one.
 * Forwarding that into the webview would be a re-render per token for a panel
 * nobody could read fast enough. The runtime keeps the two things a person
 * watching over a shoulder wants — the tool it reached for, and what it says as
 * it goes — and drops the rest.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here is kept
 *
 * This is the same discipline as a turn's thinking. The record of what a job
 * did is the message it delivers when it finishes, which is in the transcript
 * and in the prompt and in search. This is only what that record looks like
 * before it exists, so it is held in memory, bounded, and dropped when the job
 * ends. A second durable copy would eventually disagree with the first.
