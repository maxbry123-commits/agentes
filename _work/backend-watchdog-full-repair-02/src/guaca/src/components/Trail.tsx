/**
 * What an agent did on its own turn, collapsed.
 *
 * The quietest row a channel draws, and the one that used to be the loudest by
 * volume: a browsing turn spends most of its twenty-four rounds in the browser,
 * and every one of those was a line of its own reading `Chef used browse`. Now
 * a turn is chips, one per kind of work, and the calls behind a chip open in
 * place.
 *
 * Nobody is named. There is exactly one agent whose own work this can be, its
 * portrait and name are at the top of the pane, and the row this replaced put
 * that name in front of every line.
 *
 * `lib/trail.ts` decides what folds and what a chip says. This decides only how
 * it is drawn and what a click opens, so the rules can be read and tested
 * without a DOM.
