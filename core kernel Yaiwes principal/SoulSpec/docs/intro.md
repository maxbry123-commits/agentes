# What is Soul Spec?

**Soul Spec** is an open standard for defining AI agent personas. It gives your AI a persistent identity — personality, tone, behavioral rules, and workflow preferences — in a structured, portable format.

## The Problem

Every AI agent framework has its own way of handling custom instructions:
- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`
- Cursor uses `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/`
- Windsurf uses `.windsurfrules`
- OpenClaw reads `SOUL.md` from the workspace

Your agent's personality is locked to one tool. Switch frameworks, and you start over.

## The Solution

Soul Spec standardizes persona definition into a portable package:

```
my-soul/
├── soul.json       # Metadata (name, version, author, tags)
├── SOUL.md         # Core personality & behavior
├── IDENTITY.md     # Name, appearance, background
├── AGENTS.md       # Workflow rules & tool usage
├── STYLE.md        # Communication style
└── HEARTBEAT.md    # Periodic check-in behavior
```

One persona definition, multiple frameworks. Install a soul, export it to your tool's format, and your AI becomes the same agent everywhere.

## Key Features

- **Portable** — Works with OpenClaw, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any SOUL.md-compatible framework
- **Structured** — Each file has a clear purpose, not one giant prompt
- **Versioned** — Spec versions (v0.3, v0.4, v0.5) with clear migration paths
- **Secure** — SoulScan checks for prompt injection, secret leaks, and 50+ patterns
- **Shareable** — Publish to [clawsouls.ai](https://clawsouls.ai) registry, install with one command
- **Git-friendly** — Plain markdown files, clean diffs, full version history

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install and activate in one command (works without OpenClaw)
npx clawsouls install clawsouls/surgical-coder --use claude-code
```

Or create your own:

```bash
npx clawsouls init my-agent
# Edit the generated files, then publish
npx clawsouls publish ./my-agent
```

## Latest Version

The current spec version is **v0.5.2**, which introduces the **Dual Declaration Requirement** — safety laws must be declared in both `soul.json` (machine-readable) and `SOUL.md` (LLM-readable) for embodied agents.

v0.5 supports three environment types:
- **Virtual** — Text/chat-based agents (default)
- **Embodied** — Physical robots, kiosks, IoT devices
- **Hybrid** — Agents operating in both virtual and physical contexts
